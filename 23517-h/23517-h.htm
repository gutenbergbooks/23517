<h1>THE ANGEL OF THE TENEMENT.</h1>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE ADVENT OF THE ANGEL.</span></h2>

<p>The ladies of the Tenement felt that it was
a matter concerning the reputation of the
house. Therefore on this particular hot July
morning they were gathered in the apartment
of Miss Mary Carew and Miss Norma Bonkowski,
if one small and dingy room may be so
designated, and were putting the matter under
discussion.</p>

<p>Miss Carew, tall, bony, and more commonly
known to the Tenement as Miss C'rew, of
somewhat tart and acrid temper, being pressed
for her version of the story, paused in her
awkward and intent efforts at soothing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>beautiful, fair-haired child upon her lap and
explained that she was stepping out her door
that morning with her water-bucket, thinking
to get breakfast ready before Miss Bonkowski
awoke, when a child's frightened crying startled
her, coming from a room across the hall which
for some weeks had been for rent.</p>

<p>"At that," continued Miss Carew, moved to
unwonted loquacity, and patting the child industriously
while she addressed the circle of
listening ladies, "at that, 'sure as life!' says I,
and stepped across and opened the door, an'
there, settin' on this shawl, its eyes big like it
had jus' waked up, an' cryin' like to break its
heart, was this here baby. I picked her right
up an' come an' woke Norma, but it's nothin'
we can make out, 'ceptin' she's been in that
there room all night."</p>

<p>Many were the murmurs and ejaculations
from the circle of wondering ladies, while Miss
Bonkowski, a frowzy-headed lady in soiled
shirt waist and shabby skirt, with a small waist
and shoulders disproportionately broad; and
with, moreover, a dab of paint upon each high-boned
cheek,&mdash;nothing daunted by previous
failures, leaned forward and putting a some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>what
soiled finger beneath the child's pretty
chin, inquired persuasively, "And isn't the
darling going to tell its Norma its name?"</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski spoke airily and as if delivering
a part. But this the good ladies forgave,
for was not this same Miss Norma the
flower that shed an odor of distinction over the
social blossoming of the whole Tenement?
Was not Miss Bonkowski a chorus lady at The
Garden Opera House?</p>

<p>So her audience looked on approvingly while
Miss Norma snapped her fingers and chirruped
to the baby encouragingly. "And what is the
darling's name?" she repeated.</p>

<p>The little one, her pitiful sobbing momentarily
arrested, regarded Miss Bonkowski with
grave wonder. "Didn't a know I are Angel?"
she returned in egotistical surprise.</p>

<p>"Sure an' it's the truth she's spakin', fer it's
the picter of an angel she is," cried Mrs. O'Malligan,
she of the first-floor front, who added a
tidy sum to her husband's earnings by taking
in washing, and in consequence of the size of
these united incomes, no less than that of her
big heart, was regarded with much respect by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Tenement, "just look at the swate face of her,
would ye, an' the loikes of her illegant gown!"</p>

<p>"Won't it tell its Norma where it came
from? Who brought the dearie here and left
it in the naughty room? Tell its Norma,"
continued Miss Bonkowski, on her knees upon
the bare and dirty floor, and eyeing the dainty
embroidery and examining the quality of the
fine white dress while she coaxed.</p>

<p>"Yosie brought Angel&mdash;" the child began,
then as if the full realization of the strangeness
of it all returned at mention of that familiar
name, the baby turned her back on Norma and
pulling at Mary Carew's dress imperatively,
gazed up into that lady's thin, sharp face,
"Angel wants her mamma,&mdash;take Angel to
her mamma," she commanded, even while her
baby chin was quivering and the big eyes
winking to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>"Sure an' it shall go to its mammy," returned
Mrs O'Malligan soothingly, "an' whir
was it ye left her, me Angel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell its Norma where it left its
mamma," murmured Miss Bonkowski coaxingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yosie bring Angel way a way," explained
the baby obediently. "Yosie say Angel be a
good girl and her come yite back. Where
Yosie,&mdash;Angel wants Yosie to come now," and
the plaintive little voice broke into a sob, as
the child looked from one to the other of the
circle beseechingly.</p>

<p>The ladies exchanged pitying glances while
the persevering Miss Norma rattled an empty
spool in a tin cup violently to distract the
baby's thoughts. "And how old is Angel?"
she continued.</p>

<p>Again the tears were checked, while the
grave, disapproving surprise which Miss Bonkowski's
ignorance seemed to call forth, once
more overspread the small face, "Didn't a
know her are three?" she returned reprovingly,
reaching for the improvised and alluring
plaything.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," murmured Miss Bonkowski apologetically,
"Angel is three years old, of
course, a great, big girl."</p>

<p>"A gwate, big girl," repeated the baby,
nodding her pretty head approvingly, "that
what Yosie say," then with abrupt change of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
tone, "where her breakfast, her wants her
milk!"</p>

<p>"An' she shall have it, sure," cried Mrs.
O'Malligan promptly, and retired out the door
with heavy haste, while Miss Bonkowski hospitably
turned to bring forth what the apartment
could boast in the way of breakfast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other ladies withdrew to the
one window of the small room to discuss the
situation.</p>

<p>"That's it, I'm sure," one was saying, while
she twisted up her back hair afresh, "for my
man, he says he saw a woman pass our door
yesterday afternoon, kinder late, an' go on up
steps with a young 'un in her arms. He never
seen her come back, he says, but Mis' Tomlin
here, she says, she seen a woman dressed nice,
come down afterwards seemin' in a hurry, but
she didn't have no child, didn't you say, Mis'
Tomlin?"</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, timid little Mrs. Tomlin
shifted her wan-faced, fretting baby from one
arm to the other and asserted the statement to
be quite true.</p>

<p>"An'ther case of desartion," pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Mrs. O'Malligan, having returned meanwhile
with a cup filled with a thin blue liquid known
to the Tenement as <i>milk</i>, "a plain case of
desartion, an' whut's to be done about it, I
niver can say!"</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Miss Bonkowski, on her
knees before Mary and the child, crumbling
some bread into the milk, "and what are the
police for but just such cases?"</p>

<p>The other ladies glanced apprehensively at
Mrs. O'Malligan, that lady's bitter hatred of
these guardians of the public welfare being well
known, since that day when three small O'Malligans
were taken in the act of relieving a passing
Italian gentleman of a part of his stock of
bananas. Mrs. O'Malligan had paid their fines
in the City Court, had thrashed them around
as many times as her hot Irish temper had rekindled
at the memory, but had never forgiven
the police for the disgrace to the family of
O'Malligan. And being the well-to-do personage
of The Tenement, it should be remarked
that Mrs. O'Malligan's sentiments
were generally deferred to, if not always echoed
by her neighbors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' is it the polace ye'd be a-callin' in?"
she burst forth volubly, reproach and indignation
written upon the round red face she turned
upon Miss Norma, "the polace? An' would
ye be turnin' over the darlin' to the loikes of
thim, to be locked up along with thaves an'
murtherers afore night?" And, as a chorus of
assenting murmurs greeted her, with her broad,
flat foot thrust forward and hands upon her
ample hips, Mrs. O'Malligan hurried on.</p>

<p>"The polace is it ye say? An' who but
these same polace, I ask ye, was it, gettin' this
Tiniment,&mdash;as has always held it's head up
respectable,&mdash;a-gettin' this Tiniment in the
noospapers last winter along of that case of
small-pox, an' puttin' a yellow flag out, an
afther that nobody a-willin' to give me their
washin', an Miss C'rew here as could get no
pants to make, an' yerself, Miss Norma, darlint,
an' no disrespect to you a-spakin' out so bold,
a-layin' idle because of no thayater a-willin' to
have ye. An' wasn't it thim same polace
crathurs, too, I'm askin' ye, as took our rainwather
cistern away along of the fevers breakin'
out, they made bold to say, the desaivin' crathers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&mdash;an'
me a-niver havin' me washin' white a-since,
for ye'll aisy see why, usin' the muddy wather
as comes from that hydranth yirselves!"</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Malligan glanced around triumphantly,
shook her head and hurried on. "An' agin,
there's little Joey. Who was it but the polace
as come arristin' the feyther of the boy for
batin' of his own wife, and him sint up for a
year, an' she a-dyin' along of bein' weakly an'
nobody to support her, an' Joey left in this very
Tiniment an orphan child! Don't ye be a-callin'
in no polace for the loikes of this swate angel
choild, Miss Norma darlint, don't ye be doin'
it! An' the most of thim once foine Irish
gintlemen, bad luck to the loikes of thim!"</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Malligan paused,&mdash;she was obliged to,&mdash;for
breath, whereupon Miss Bonkowski very
amiably hastened to declare she meant no
harm, having absolutely no knowledge of the
class whatever, "except," with arch humor, "as
presented on the stage, where, as everybody
who had seen them there knew, they were
harmless enough, goodness knows!" And the
airy chorus lady shrugged her shoulders and
smiled at her own bit of pleasantry. "But for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the matter of that, I still think something
ought to be done, and what other means can
we find for restoring the lost innocent?" and
Miss Norma tossed her frizzled blonde head,
quite enjoying, if the truth be told, the touch
of romance about the affair. For once she
seemed to be meeting, in real life, a situation
worthy of the boards of The Garden Opera
House, in whose stage vernacular a missing
child was always a "lost innocent." "If we do
not call on the police, Mrs. O'Malligan, how are
we to ever find the child's mother?"</p>

<p>Here Mary Carew looked up, and there was
something like a metallic click about Mary's
hard, dry tones as she spoke, for the years she
had spent in making jeans pantaloons at one
dollar and a half a dozen had not been calculated
to sweeten her tones to mellowness, nor
to induce her to regard human nature with
charity.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" she said bluntly,
"all the huntin' in the world ain't goin' to find
a mother what don't mean to be found?"</p>

<p>"But what makes you so sure she don't?"
persisted Miss Bonkowski, letting the child take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
possession of spoon and cup, and quite revelling
in the further touch of the dramatic developing
in the situation.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Mary pressed the child to her
as she spoke. "It's as plain as everything else
that's wrong and hard in this world," she said,
and each word clicked itself off with metallic
sharpness and decision, "the mother brought
the child here late yesterday, waited until it
was asleep in the room over there, then went
off and left it. Why she chose this here particular
Tenement we don't know and likely never
will, though I ain't no doubt myself there's a
reason. It ain't a pretty story or easy to understand
but it's common enough, and you'll
find that mother never means to be found, an'
in as big a city as this 'n', tain't no use to
try."</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;cannot&mdash;believe it," murmured
Norma&mdash;in her best stage tones. Then she
turned again to the child. "And how did it
come here, dearie? Has baby a papa&mdash;where
is baby's papa?"</p>

<p>The little one rattled the tin spoon around
the sides of the cup. "Papa bye," she returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
chasing a solitary crumb intently. "Yosie
sick, mamma sick, Tante sick, but Angel, her
ain't sick when she come way a way on&mdash;on&mdash;"
a worried look flitted over the flushed little
face, and she looked up at Norma expectantly
as if expecting her to supply the missing word,
"on,&mdash;Angel come way a way on&mdash;<i>vaisseau</i>&mdash;"
at last with baby glee she brought the word
forth triumphantly, "Papa bye and Angel and
mamma and Tante and Yosie come way a way
on <i>vaisseau</i>!"</p>

<p>"You see," said Mary Carew, looking at
Norma, and the others shook their heads sadly.</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski accepted the situation.
"Though what a vasso is, or a tante either, is
beyond me to say," she murmured.</p>

<p>"But what is goin' to be done with her,
then?" ventured little Mrs. Tomlin, holding
her own baby closer as she spoke.</p>

<p>There was a pause which nobody seemed to
care to break, during which more than one of
the women saw the child on Mary's knee
through dim eyes which turned the golden hair
into a halo of dazzling brightness. Then
Norma got up and began to clear away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
remains of breakfast and to clatter the crockery
from stove and table together for washing,
while Mary Carew, avoiding the others' glances,
busied herself by awkwardly wiping the child's
mouth and chin with a corner of her own faded
cotton dress.</p>

<p>Submitting as if the process was a matter of
course, the baby gazed meanwhile into Mary's
colorless, bony and unlovely face. Perhaps
the childish eyes found something behind its
hardness not visible to older and less divining
insight, for one soft hand forthwith stole up to
the hollow cheek, while the other pulled at the
worn sleeve for attention. "What a name?"
the clear little voice lisped inquiringly.</p>

<p>Poor Mary looked embarrassed, but awkwardly
lent herself to the caress as if, in spite
of her shamefacedness, she found it not unpleasant.</p>

<p>The baby's eyes regarded her with sad surprise.
"A got no name, poor&mdash;poor&mdash;a got no
name," then she broke forth, and as if quite
overcome with the mournfulness of Mary's
condition, the little head burrowed back into
the hollow of the supporting arm, that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
might the better gaze up and study the face of
this object for pity and wonder.</p>

<p>Poor Mary Carew&mdash;would that some one of
the hundreds of un-mothered and unloved little
ones in the great city had but found it out
sooner&mdash;her starved heart had been hungering
all her life, and now her arms closed about the
child.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll keep her till somebody comes
for her," she said with a kind of defiance, as if
ashamed of her own weakness, "it'll only
mean," with a grim touch of humor in her
voice, "it'll only mean a few more jean pantaloons
a week to make any how."</p>

<p>"We'll share her keep between us alike,
Mary Carew," declared Norma, haughtily, with
a real, not an affected toss, of the frizzed head
now, "what is your charge, is mine too, I'd
have you know!"</p>

<p>"Sure, an' we'll all do a part for the name of
the house," said Mrs. O'Malligan, "an' be
proud." And the other ladies agreeing to this
more or less warmly, the matter was considered
as settled.</p>

<p>"An' as them as left her know where she is,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
said Mary Carew, the click quite decided again
in her tones, "if they want her, they know
where to come and get her&mdash;but&mdash;you hear to
what I say, Norma, they'll never come!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE ENTERTAINERS OF THE ANGEL.</span></h2>

<p>It was one thing for the good ladies of the
Tenement to settle the matter thus, but another
entirely for the high-spirited, passionate
little stranger,&mdash;bearing every mark of refined
birth and good breeding in her finely-marked
features, her straight, slim white body, her
slender hands and feet, her dainty ways and
fearless bearing,&mdash;to adapt herself to the
situation. The first excitement over, her terror
and fright returned, and the cry went up unceasingly
in lisping English interspersed with
words utterly unintelligible to the two distracted
ladies, begging to be taken to that mother of
whom Mary Carew entertained so poor an
opinion.</p>

<p>It was in vain that good woman, with a tenderness
and patience quite at variance with her
harsh tones, rocked, petted, coaxed and tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to satisfy with vague promises of "to-morrow."
In vain did Norma, no less earnestly now that
the touch of romance had faded into grim responsibility,
whistle and sing and snap her
fingers, the terror was too real, the sense of
loss too poignant, the baby heart refused
to be comforted, and it was only when exhaustion
came that the child would moan herself
to sleep in Mary's arms.</p>

<p>So passed several days, the baby drooping
and pining, but clinging to Mary through it
all, with a persistency which, while it won her
heart entirely, sadly interfered with the progress
of jean pantaloons.</p>

<p>As for the more material Norma, whose
time, free from the requirements of her profession,
had hitherto been largely given to reshaping
her old garments in imitations of the
ever-changing fashions, finding that the baby
clung to Mary, she bore no malice, but good-naturedly
turned her skill toward making the
poor accommodations of their room meet the
needs of the occasion, and in addition appointed
herself maid to her small ladyship. And an
arduous task it ultimately proved, for, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
child gradually became reconciled and began
to play about, a dozen times a day a little pair
of hands were stretched toward Norma and a
sweet, tearful voice proclaimed in accents of
anguished grief, "Angel's hands so-o-o dirty!"&mdash;which
indeed they were each time, her surroundings
being of that nature which rubbed
off at every touch.</p>

<p>Indeed so pronounced was the new inmate's
dislike to dirt, that Mary, sensitive to criticism,
took to rising betimes these hot mornings and
making the stuffy room sweet with cleanliness.
Not so easy a task as one might imagine either,
in an apartment which combined kitchen,
laundry, bedroom, dining-room and the other
conveniences common to housekeeping in a
12 &times; 15 space, as evidenced by the presence of
a stove, a table with a tub concealed beneath, a
machine, a bed, a washstand, two chairs, and
a gayly decorated bureau, Norma's especial
property, set forth with bottles of perfumery, a
satin pin-cushion and a bunch of artificial
flowers in a vase. And in putting the room
thus to rights, when it is considered that every
drop of water used upon floor, table or window,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
had to be carried up four flights of stairs,
the sincerity of Mary's conversion to the
angelic way of regarding things cannot be
doubted.</p>

<p>Nor, if Mary's word can be taken, were these
efforts wasted upon her little ladyship, who,
awakened by the bustle on the very first occasion
of Mary's crusade against the general disorder,
sat up in the crib donated by Mrs.
O'Malligan,&mdash;the last of the O'Malligans being
now in trousers,&mdash;and hung over the side with
every mark of approving interest. And happy
with something to love and an object to work
for, Mary continued to scrub on with a heart
strangely light. "And I couldn't slight the
corners if I wanted to," she told her neighbors,
"with them great solemn eyes a-watchin' an'
a-follerin' me."</p>

<p>It was on a morning following one of these
general upheavals and straightenings that the
three sat down to breakfast, the two ladies
feeling unwontedly virtuous and elegant by
reason of their clean surroundings. The Angel
seeming brighter and more willing to leave
Mary's side, Norma put her into one of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
two chairs, and herself sat on the bed. But no
sooner had the baby grabbed her cracked mug
than her smooth forehead began to pucker, and,
setting it down again, she regarded Norma
earnestly. "Didn't a ought to <i>say</i> something?"
she demanded, and her eyes grew
dark with puzzled questioning.</p>

<p>"And what should you say, darling?" returned
Norma, leaning over to crumble some
bread into the milk which a little judicious
pinching in other directions made possible for
the child.</p>

<p>The baby studied her bread and milk intently.
"Jesus"&mdash;she lisped, then hesitated,
and her worried eyes sought Norma's again,&mdash;"J&eacute;sus"&mdash;then
with a sudden joyful burst of
inspiration, "Amen," she cried and seized her
mug triumphantly.</p>

<p>"It's a blessing she is asking," said Norma
with tears in her eyes, "I know, for I've seen
it done on the stage, though what with the
food being pasteboard cakes and colored
plaster fruit, I never took much stock in it
before," and she laughed somewhat unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Bread and butter, come to supper," sang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the baby with sudden glee, "that what Tante
says.&mdash;Where Angel's Tante?" and with the
recollection her face changed, and the pretty
pointed chin began to quiver. A moment of
indecision, and she slipped down from her
chair. "Kiss Angel bye," she commanded,
tugging at Mary's skirts, "her goin' to Tante,"
the little face fierce with determination, every
curl bobbing with the emphatic nods of the
little head, "kiss her bye, C'rew," and the wild
sobs began again.</p>

<p>So passed a week, but, for all the added care
and responsibility, the longer this wayward, imperious
little creature, with the hundred moods
for every hour, was hers, the less was Mary
Carew disposed to consider the possibility of
any one coming to claim her. Not so with the
blonde-tressed chorus lady, who combined more
of worldly wisdom with her no less kindly
heart. Patiently she tried to win the child's
further confidence, to stimulate the baby memory,
to unravel the lisped statements. But it
was in vain. Smiles indeed, she won at length,
through tears, and little sad returns to her
playful sallies, but the little one's words were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
too few, her ideas too confused, for Norma to
learn anything definite from her lispings.</p>

<p>But Norma was not satisfied. "My heart
misgives me," she murmured in the tragic
accents she so loved to assume,&mdash;one evening
as she pinned on her cheap and showy lace hat
and adjusted its wealth of flowers, preparatory
to starting to the Garden Opera House, "my
heart misgives me. It seems to me it is our
duty, Mary, to do something about this,&mdash;to
report it&mdash;somehow,&mdash;somewhere"&mdash;she ended
vaguely. "Hadn't I better speak to a policeman
after all?"</p>

<p>Mary Carew drew the child,&mdash;drowsing in
her arms,&mdash;to her quickly. "No," she said,
and her thin, bony face looked almost fierce,
"no, for if you did and they couldn't find her
people, which you know as well as I do they
couldn't, do you s'pose they'd give her back to
us? They'd put her in a refuge or 'sylum,
that's what they'd do, where, while maybe she'd
have more to eat, she'd be enough worse off, a-starvin'
for a motherin' word!"</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski, abashed at Mary's fierce
attack, made an attempt to speak, but Mary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
vehemently interrupting, hurried on: "I know
whereas I speak, Norma Bonkowski, I know, I
know. I've gone through it all myself. I ain't
never told you," and the knobby face burned
a dull red, "I was county poor, where I come
from in the state, an' sent to th' poor-house at
four years old, myself, and I know, Norma, the
miseries whereas I speak of. And the Lord
helpin' me," with grim solemnity, "an' since
He sent you here huntin' a room, an' since He
helped me get the machine, hard to run as it is,
somehow I'm believin' more He's the Lord of
us poor folks too,&mdash;an' Him a-helpin' me to
turn out one more pair of pants a day, I'll never
be the means of puttin' no child in a refuge no-how
an' no time. An' there it is, how I feel
about it!"</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski turned from a partial view
of herself such as the abbreviated glass to her
bureau afforded. "Well," she said amiably,
"coming as I did from across the ocean as a
child," and she nodded her head in the supposed
direction of the Atlantic, "and, until late
years, always enjoying a good home, what with
father getting steady work as a scene-painter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as I've told you often, and me going on in the
chorus off and on, and having my own bit of
money, I don't really know about the asylums
in this country. But I have heard say they are
so fine, people ain't against deserting their
children just to get 'em in such places knowin'
they'll be educated better'n they can do themselves."</p>

<p>Mary's pale eyes blazed. "Do you mean,
Norma Bonkowski," she demanded angrily,
"that you'd rather she should go?"</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski shrugged her shoulders
somewhat haughtily. "How you do talk,
Mary! You know I don't,&mdash;but neither do I
believe she is any deserted child, and it's worrying
me constant, what we ought to do. Poor
as I am, and what with father dying and the
manager cutting my salary as I get older,&mdash;I'll
admit it to you, Mary, though I wouldn't have
him know I'm having another birthday to-day&mdash;"
with a laugh and a shrug, "why, as I
say, I am pretty poor, but every cent I've got
is yours and the child's, and you know it, Mary
Carew," and the good-hearted chorus-lady, with
a reproachful backward glance at her room-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>mate,
flounced out the door, leaving the re-assured
Mary to sew, by the light of an ill-smelling
lamp, until her return from the theatre near
midnight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">INTRODUCES THE LITTLE MAJOR.</span></h2>

<p>While the fine, embroidered dress in which
the Angel had made her appearance was all
Mrs. O'Malligan had claimed it as to daintiness
and quality, after a few days' wear, its daintiness
gave place to dirt, its quality thinned to
holes.</p>

<p>Upon this the Tenement was called into
consultation. The Angel must be clothed, but
what, even from its cosmopolitan wardrobe,
could the house produce suitable for angelic
wear? Many lands indeed were represented
by the inmates who now called its shelter
home, but none from that country where
Angels are supposed to have their being.</p>

<p>"On my word," quoth Miss Bonkowski to
the ladies gathered in the room at her bidding,
and Miss Norma gave an eloquent shrug and
elevated her blackened eyebrows as she spoke,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"on my word I believe her little heart would
break if she had to stay in dirty, ragged clothes
very long. Such a darling for being washed
and curled, such a precious for always cleaning
up! It makes me sure she must be different,"&mdash;Miss
Norma was airy but she was also humble,
recognizing perhaps her own inherent shrinking
from too frequent an application of soap and
water&mdash;"she's something different, born and
bred, from such as me!"</p>

<p>But at this the ladies murmured. Miss
Bonkowski had been their pride, their boast,
nor did their allegiance falter now, even in the
face of the Angel's claims to superiority.</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski was not ungrateful for this
expression of loyalty, which she acknowledged
with a smile, as she tightened the buckle on
the very high-heeled and coquettish slipper she
was rejuvenating, but she protested, nevertheless,
that all this did not alter the fact that the
Angel must be clothed.</p>

<p>"As fer th' dirt," said the energetic Mrs.
O'Malligan, on whose ample lap the Angel was
at that moment sitting in smiling friendliness,
"sure an' I'll be afther washin' her handful uv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
clothes ivery wake, meself, an' what with them
dozens of dresses I'm doin' fer Mrs. Tony's
childers all th' time, it's surely a few she'd be a-givin'
me, whin I tell her about th' darlint, an'
me a niver askin' fer nothin' at all, along of all
mine bein' boys. Sure an' I'll be a-beggin' her
this very day, I will, whin I carry me washin'
home."</p>

<p>And Mrs. O'Malligan being as good as her
word, and Mrs. Tony successfully interviewed,
the good Irish lady returned home in triumph
bearing a large bundle of cast-off garments, and
at once summoned the Tenement to her apartments.</p>

<p>The first arrived ladies were already giving
vent to their appreciation of the Tony generosity
when Miss Carew and Miss Bonkowski
arrived, Mary's bony face, in deference to the
angelic prejudices now ruling her, red and
smarting from an energetic application of the
same soap as ministered to her room's needs,
but beaming with a grim pride as she bore the
radiant Angel, wild with delight at getting out
of her narrow quarters.</p>

<p>Yielding to the popular voice, though not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
without reluctance, Mary placed her darling in
Mrs. O'Malligan's lap, and the process of exhibiting
and trying on the garments began at
once.</p>

<p>For a time her small ladyship yielded graciously,
until seeing her pretty feet bared that
the little stockings and half worn shoes might
be fitted, she suddenly cast her eyes about the
circle of ladies, and won by the pretty, dark
beauty of young Mrs. Repetto, the Tenement's
bride of a month's standing, imperiously demanded
that lady to take the pink toes to
market.</p>

<p>Overcome with having the public attention
thus drawn upon her, pretty Mrs. Repetto in
the best Italian-English she could muster, confessed
her inability to either understand or
comply, whereupon the baby, bearing no
malice in her present high good-humor, proceeded
to take them herself.</p>

<p>"This little pig went to market," the angelic
accents declared, while her ladyship smiled
sweetly upon Mrs. Repetto, and Mary Carew
breathlessly motioned for silence with all the
pride of a doting parent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"This little pig stayed home&mdash;" the ladies
on the outskirts pressed near that they too
might hear.</p>

<p>"This little pig had bread and cheese,"
whereupon Mrs. Repetto recovering, went
down on her knees to be nearer the scene of
exploit.</p>

<p>"This little pig had none;" the interest now
was breathless, and as the last little pig went
squeaking home the ladies nearest fell upon
the darling and covered her with kisses.</p>

<p>"An' it's jus' that smart she is, all the time,"
declared Mary Carew proudly, "an' 'taint like
she's showin' off, either, is it, Norma?"</p>

<p>When at last the trying on was over, and
the Tony generosity was sufficiently enlarged
upon, the ladies, as is the way with the best of
the sex, fell into a mild gossip before separating.
And while racy bits of Tenement shortcomings
were being handed around, the small
object of this gathering, too young, alas, to
know the joys denied her because of her limited
abilities to understand the nature of the
conversation, slipped down from Mrs. O'Malligan's
lap, and eluding Mary's absent hold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
proceeded to journey about the room, until
reaching the open door, she took her way, unobserved,
out of the O'Malligan first floor front
and leaving its glories of red plush furniture
and lace curtains behind her, forthwith made
her way out the hall door into the street.</p>

<p>The hot, garbage-strewn pavements and sunbaked
gutters swarmed with the sons and
daughters of the Tenement. Directly opposite
its five-storied front was the rear entrance to
the Fourth Regiment Armory. And there, at
that moment, a sad-eyed, swarthy Italian,&mdash;swinging
his hand-organ down on the asphalt
pavement in front of the Armory's open doors,
was beginning to grind out his melodies. And
with the first note, children came running, from
doorstep and curb, from sidewalk and gutter,
while, at the same moment, in the open door
of the Armory appeared a small, chubby-cheeked
boy, who had upon his head a soldier
cap so much too large for him as to cover the
tips of his ears entirely, and who, moreover,
wore, buckled about his waist, a belt gay as to
trimmings and glittering with silver finishings.
If the Fourth Regiment boasted a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Company of Lilliputian Guards here surely
was a member.</p>

<p>The Angel, in the Tenement door, was enchanted.
How different a world from that
upstairs room under the roof! She kept step
to the music and nodded her head to the fascinating
little boy in the Armory door. And the
sharp eyes of that young gentleman had no
sooner espied the nodding little creature in the
doorway opposite, than heels together, head
erect, up went a quick hand to the military cap.
The Angel was being saluted, and while her
ignorance of the fact prevented her appreciating
that honor, the friendliness of the little
boy was alluring. Down the steps she came,
her little feet tripping to the measure of the
music, her skirts outheld, and flitting across
the pavement and over the curb, she made for
the group of children in the street. Cobblestones,
however, being strange to the baby
feet, up those dancing members tripped and
down the Angel fell, just as a wagon came
dashing around the corner of the streets.</p>

<p>Out rushed the small boy from the Armory
door, and, scattering the crowd around the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
organ, caught the fallen Angel by the arm, and
raised his hand with an air of authority, as,
with a grin, the driver on the wagon drew up
his horse and surveyed the group, and the sad-eyed
Italian, recognizing the superior attraction,
shouldered his organ and moved
on.</p>

<p>"Hello," cried the man on the wagon seeing
the child was not hurt, "yer can soak me one
if it ain't little Joe! Where'd yer git dem togs,
kid? What'r' yer goin' in fer anyhow, baby
perlice?"</p>

<p>The region in the neighborhood of Joey's
waist swelled with pride, and his chubby face
bore a look of wounded dignity. "There ain't
no perlice about this yere, Bill, it's a sojer I be,
see?"</p>

<p>Being pressed by Bill to explain himself, Joey
unbent. "Yer see, Bill, Dad ain't never showed
up fer to git me&mdash;seen anything of Dad since
he got out, Bill?"</p>

<p>Bill nodded.</p>

<p>"What's he up to now?" queried Joey.</p>

<p>"Shovin' the queer," admitted Bill laconically,
"nabbed right off an' in the cooler waitin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
his turn, yer won't be troubled by him fer
quite a spell, I'll give yer dat fer a pointer,
see?"</p>

<p>Joey saw, and for the space of half a second
seemed somewhat sobered by the intelligence.
"I guessed as much," said he, "yer see, after
he got nabbed first, mammy she&mdash;yer didn't
know as mammy took an' died, did yer, Bill?"
and Joey faltered and let the Angel take possession
of his cap and transfer it to her own
curly head while the Tenement children applauded
with jeering commendation, seeing
there was a standing feud between Joey and
the rest of the juvenile populace over its possession.</p>

<p>"No," Bill allowed, he did not know it, but,
seeing that she was always ailing, Bill was in
no wise surprised.</p>

<p>"An'&mdash;an' since then, I'm stayin' over ter
th' Arm'ry wid Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. Yer know him,
Bill, Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. what takes care of th' Arm'ry.
He was there afore yer left th' grocery."</p>

<p>Bill remembered the gentleman.</p>

<p>"I stays wid him an' he drills me an' makes
me scrub, hully gee, how he do make me wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
meself, Bill! An' there's one sojer-man, th'
Cap'n, he give me these togs, he did, an' he
tol' Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. to lem'me eat along wid him
over ter Dutchy's Res'traunt," nodding toward
a cheap eating-house at the corner, "an' he'd
stand fer it. They calls me major, all of 'em
to th' Arm'ry, Bill, see?" and Joey was waxing
voluble indeed, when he turned to see the
mob of jeering children make off up the street,
his cap in their midst, while the wailing Angel
was being rescued from under the horse's very
hoofs by Mary Carew.</p>

<p>Joey put his spirit of inquiry before even his
cap. "Is she er Angel, say?" he inquired of
Miss Carew, turning his back on Bill without
ceremony who with a grin and a nod to the
group of Tenement ladies at the door, drove
off, "I heerd yer had er Angel over there, but
I didn't know as it was straight, what they
was givin' me, see?"</p>

<p>"That's what she is, the darling yonder,"
declared Miss Bonkowski from the curbstone,
nodding airily, "you've got it straight this
time, Joey. And if what Peter O'Malligan
says about your picking her up just now is so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
you're welcome to come over some time and
play with her."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's true," supplemented Mary Carew,
trying to pacify the struggling Angel in her
arms who, gazing after the children, showed a
decided inclination to descend to human level
and mingle with them of earth, "it's true an'
that's jus' what she is,&mdash;the Angel of this Tenement,
an', as Norma says, you're free to come
over and play with her, though there ain't
many of you I'd say it to;" and with that the
tall, gaunt Mary bearing the baby, followed
Norma into the house and up the narrow,
broken stairs, and along the dark halls past door
after door closed upon its story of squalor and
poverty, until, at last, panting with the child's
weight, she reached their own abode under the
roof.</p>

<p>"Which," as Mary had been wont, in the
past, to observe, "was about as near Heaven
as the poor need look to get." But now, for
some reason, these bitter speeches were growing
less frequent on Mary Carew's lips since she
opened her door to entertain an Angel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE ANGEL BECOMES A FAIRY.</span></h2>

<p>July passed, and in August, the heat in the
room beneath the roof set the air to shimmering
like a veil before the open window, and Mary
Carew, gasping, found it harder and harder to
make that extra pair of jean pantaloons a day.
And, as though the manager at the Garden
Opera House had divined that Miss Bonkowski
had left another birthday behind her, like milestones
along the way, that lady's salary received
a cut on the first day of August.</p>

<p>At best, the united incomes of the two made
but a meagre sum, and there was nothing for
it now but to reduce expenses. The rent being
one thing that was never cut, the result was
a scantier allowance of food. Moreover, the
mortals seeing to it that their heavenly visitant
had her full craving satisfied, it was small
wonder that the bones in Mary's face pressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
more like knobs than ever against the tight-drawn
skin, or that the spirits of the airy, hopeful,
buoyant Norma flagged. Indeed, had not
the warm-hearted, loving little creature, repaid
them with quick devotion, filling their meagre
lives with new interests and affections, despair
or worse&mdash;regret for their generous impulse&mdash;must
now have seized their hearts.</p>

<p>Invitations, too, grew rare, from the other
ladies of the Tenement, bidding the little
stranger whose simple friendliness and baby
dignity had won them all, to dine or to sup,
for hard times had fallen upon them also. A
strike at a neighboring foundry, the shutting
down of the great rolling-mill by the river had
sent their husbands home for a summer vacation,
with, unfortunately, no provision for
wages, a state of affairs forbidding even angels'
visits, when the angel possessed so human a
craving for bread.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. O'Malligan, whose chief patron,
Mrs. Tony, together with her children and their
dozens of dresses, had gone for a summer outing,
had no more on her table than her own
family could dispose of.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Angel,&mdash;"'Eaving bless her," as Mrs.
Tomlin was wont to observe when the Angel,
coming to see the baby, would stand with grave
wonder, touching the pallid little cheek with a
rosy finger to make the baby smile,&mdash;the Angel
noted nothing of all this. Even the memory
of "<i>Mamma</i>" was fading, and Mary, Norma,
the Tenement, the friendly children swarming
staircase and doorway, were fast becoming her
small world.</p>

<p>With instinct born of her profession, the
chorus-lady had long ago recognized the wonderful
grace and buoyancy of the child's every
movement, and to her surprise found that the
baby had quite a knowledge of dancing.</p>

<p>"Who taught you how, my precious?" she
would ask, when the child, as if from the very
love of motion, would catch and spread her
skirts, and, with pointed toe, trip about the
room, "tell your Norma who taught the darling
how to dance?"</p>

<p>The baby glancing over her shoulder, with
the little frown of displeasure that always
greeted such ignorance on Norma's part, had
but one reply: "Tante," she would declare, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
continue her measured walk about the floor.
So, for pastime, Norma began teaching her the
figures of a dance then on the boards at the
Opera House, to which her little ladyship lent
herself with readiness. The motions, sometimes
approaching the grotesque in the lean and
elderly chorus-lady as she bobbed about the
limited space, courtesying, twirling, pirouetting,
her blonde hair done up in kids,&mdash;herself
in the abbreviated toilet of pink calico sack and
petticoat reserved for home hours, changed to
unconscious grace and innocent abandon in
the light, clean-limbed child, who learned with
quickness akin to instinct, and who seemed to
follow Norma's movements almost before they
were completed.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful&mdash;amazing!" Miss Bonkowski
would exclaim, pausing for breath, "it is
<i>genius</i>," and her voice would pause and fall
reverently before the words, and the lesson
would be resumed with greater enthusiasm
than before.</p>

<p>But many were the days when, Norma away
at rehearsal and Mary Carew, hot, tired, alas,
even cross,&mdash;totally irresponsive to anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but the stitching of jean pantaloons,&mdash;the
Angel would grow tired of the stuffy room and
long for the forbidden dangers and delights of
Tenement sidewalks. Then, often, with nothing
else to do, she would catch up her tiny
skirts and whirl herself into the dance Norma
had taught her, in and out among the furniture
crowding the room, humming little broken
snatches of music for herself, bending, swaying,
her bright eyes full of laughter as they met
Mary's tired ones, her curls bobbing, until
breathless, hot and weary she would drop on
the floor and fall asleep, her head pillowed on
her soft dimpled arm.</p>

<p>But on one of these long, hot mornings when
the heat seemed to stream in as from a furnace
at the window and even the flies buzzed
languidly, the Angel was seized with another
idea for passing time. Her vocabulary of Tenement
vernacular was growing too, and she
chattered unceasingly.</p>

<p>"C'rew, didn't a fink Angel might go find
her mamma?" she demanded on this particular
morning.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said C'rew, and the click in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
her tired voice sounded even above the whirring
of the heavy machine, for C'rew's head ached
and her back ached, and possibly her heart ached
too, for herself and Norma and the child and
poor people in one-windowed tenement rooms
in general.</p>

<p>"Didn't a fink she might go play with little
Joey?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary decidedly, and she leaned
back wearily and pushed her thin, colorless
hair off her hot, throbbing temples, "no, you
played down on the pavement with Joey an'
th' rest yesterday, an the sun made you sick.
But," with haste to avert the cloud lowering
over the baby face, "if you'll be real good an'
not worry her, you can go down an' see Mrs.
O'Malligan."</p>

<p>Fair weather prevailed again on the pretty
face, and at Mary's word the Angel was at the
open door, tugging at the chair placed crossways
to keep her from venturing out unobserved,
and with a sigh and a guilty look at the
pile of unfinished work, Mary rose and carried
her down to the good Irish lady's door, and,
with a word, hurried back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. O'Malligan, big, beaming and red,
smiled a moist but hearty welcome from over
her tubs toward the little figure in the faded
gingham standing shyly in the open doorway.
"An' it's proud to see ye I am, me Angel," she
declared, "though there's never a childer in
call to be playin' wid ye."</p>

<p>But the Angel, nothing daunted, smiled back
in turn, and climbed into a chair, and the two
forthwith fell into friendly conversation, though
it is doubtful if either understood one-half of
what the other was talking about.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. O'Malligan, with many apologies,
went out into the back court to hang out
the last of the family wash, and on her return,
stopping short in the doorway, her jolly red
face spread into a responsive smile. "The
saints presarve us," she cried, "would ye look
at the child?" for in the tub of blue rinsing
water sat the gleeful Angel, water trickling
from her yellow hair and from every stitch of
clothing, while her evident enjoyment of the
cool situation found a response in Mrs. O'Malligan's
kind and indulgent heart.</p>

<p>"Angel take a baf," was the smiling though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
superfluous explanation which came from the
infant Undine.</p>

<p>"An' it's right ye are," laughed Mrs. O'Malligan,
"an' sure I'll be afther givin' ye a rale wan
meself," and filling an empty tub with clean
water, the brisk lady soon had the baby stripped
to her firm, white skin and standing in the
tub.</p>

<p>And what with the splashings of the naughty
feet, and the wicked tumbles into the soap-suds
every time the mischievous little body was
rinsed, and Mrs. O'Malligan's "Whist, be aisy,"
and "It's a tormentin' darlint ye are," they
heard nothing of the knocks at the door or the
calls, nor knew that Miss Bonkowski, in street
dress and hat, had entered, until she stood
beside them with an armful of clean clothes.</p>

<p>"Was there ever such luck," she cried excitedly,
"to find her all washed and just ready!
Mary said she was here, and so I just brought
her clean clothes down with me to save a trip
back upstairs. Wipe her quickly, please," and
with hands and tongue going, Miss Norma explained
that one of the children in the juvenile
dance on the boards at The Garden Opera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
House had been suddenly taken ill, and a
matin&eacute;e advertised for the next day.</p>

<p>"And it happens lucky enough," she went
on, addressing the ladies who, catching wind of
the excitement, had speedily gathered about
the doorway, "it just happens I have been
teaching her this very dance, and if she don't
get frightened, I believe she will be able to
take the place."</p>

<p>So saying, Miss Bonkowski gave a pull out
and a last finishing pat to the strings of the
embroidered muslin bonnet the child had worn
on her first appearance, and taking her, clean,
dainty, smiling and expectant, into her arms,
Miss Norma plunged out of the comparative
coolness of the Tenement hallway into the
glare of the August sun.</p>

<p>But all this while the little brain was at work.
"Goin' to Angel's mamma,&mdash;her goin' to her
mamma," suddenly the child broke forth as
Norma hurried along the hot streets, and the
little hand beat a gleeful tattoo as it rested on
Norma's shoulder.</p>

<p>Norma paused on the crowded sidewalk, to
take breath beneath the shade of a friendly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
awning. "Not to-day, my angel," she panted,
"to-day your Norma is going to take her precious
where there are ever so many nice little
girls for her to dance with."</p>

<p>"Angel likes to dance with little girls,
Norma," admitted the baby, while Norma made
ready to thread her way across the street through
the press of vehicles.</p>

<p>"I'll not say one word to her about being
frightened," reflected the wise chorus lady,
"and she's such an eager little darling, thinking
of other things and trying to do her best,
maybe she won't think of it. If she can only
keep the place while that child is sick,&mdash;what a
help the money would be!"&mdash;and the usually
hopeful Norma sighed as she hurried in the side
entrance of the handsome stone building known
to the public as The Garden Opera House.</p>

<p class='spaced'>*****</p>

<p>The next afternoon, at The Garden Opera
House, as the bell rang for the curtain to rise,
Mary Carew, in best attire of worn black dress
and cheap straw hat, was putting the Angel
into the absent fairy's cast-off shell, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
consisted of much white tarlatan as to skirts
and much silver tinsel as to waist, with a pair
of wonderful gauzy wings at sight of which the
Angel was enraptured.</p>

<p>Miss Bonkowski being, as she expressed it,
"on in the first scene," Mary Carew had been
obliged to forsake jean pantaloons for the time
being and come to take charge of the child,
who in her earnest, quick, enthusiastic little
fashion had done her part and gone through
the rehearsal better even than the sanguine
Norma had hoped, and after considerable drilling
had satisfied the authorities that she could
fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>As for the Angel, in her friendly fashion
she had enjoyed herself hugely, accepting the
homage of the other children like a small queen,
graciously permitting herself to be enthused
over by the various ladies who, like Norma,
constituted "the chorus," and carrying home
numerous offerings, from an indigestible wad
of candy known as "an all-day-sucker," given
her by her fairy-partner, to a silver quarter given
her by the blonde and handsome tenor.</p>

<p>"She is the most fascinating little creature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
I ever met in my life," the prima donna had
cried to the excited Miss Bonkowski, who had
never been addressed by that great personage
before,&mdash;"did you ever see such heavenly eyes,&mdash;not
blue&mdash;violet&mdash;and such a smile&mdash;like the
sun through tears! Who is she,&mdash;where did
she come from? Such grace,&mdash;such poise!"</p>

<p>The Angel's story was recited to quite an
audience, in Miss Bonkowski's most dramatic
manner. But long before the chorus lady had
finished, the great singer, lending but a wandering
attention after the few facts were gathered,
had coaxed the child into her silken lap, and
with the mother touch which lies in every real
woman's fingers from doll-baby days upward,
was fondling and re-touching the rings of shining
hair, and, with the mother-notes which a
child within one's arms brings into every
womanly woman's voice, was cooing broken
endearments into the little ear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Angel gazed into the beautiful
face with the calm and critical eyes of childhood.
But what she saw there must have satisfied,
for, with a sigh of content, she finally
settled back against the encircling arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
"Pretty lady," was her candid comment.
"Angel loves her."</p>

<p>Flattered and praised as she had been, it is
doubtful if the great singer had ever received
a tribute to her charms that pleased her more.
"Bring her to my room to-morrow to dress her,"
she said to Miss Bonkowski in soft, winning
tones that were nevertheless a command, unpinning
the two long-stemmed roses she wore
and putting them in the baby fingers, "and
bring her early, mind!" And so it was that
Mary Carew, nervous and awkward, was there
now, doing her best to dress the excited little
creature, whom nothing could keep still a
second at a time.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," Mary managed to
breathe as the great personage, turning the full
radiance of her beauty upon the bewildered
seamstress, took the necklace of flashing jewels
from her maid's fingers and bade her help Mary.</p>

<p>The great lady laughed. "You're nervous,
aren't you?" she said good-humoredly, too
human not to be pleased at this unconscious
tribute on Mary's part.</p>

<p>"If the child can only do it right, ma'am,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
said Mary, in a voice she hardly knew for her
own, overcome this by graciousness no less than
by the splendor.</p>

<p>"Right," said the lady, clasping a bracelet
upon her round, white arm, and settling her
trailing draperies preparatory to going on,
"right! Of course she will, who ever heard of
an Angel going wrong!" and laughing she
sailed away.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Miss Bonkowski, rushing in a
little later, "give her to me, quick, Mary! If
you stand right here in the wings you can see
nicely," and the excited lady, wonderful as to
her blonde befrizzlement, gorgeous as to pink
skirt, blue bodice and not the most cleanly of
white waists, bore the Angel, like a rosebud
in a mist of gauze, away.</p>

<p>Left alone amid the bustle and confusion
Mary stood where Norma had directed, gazing
out upon the stage like one in a dream. Never
in all her colorless life had she been in the
midst of such bewildering splendors before.
Was it any wonder that Norma Bonkowski was
different from the rest of the Tenement when
she shared such scenes daily?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Still further dazed by the music and the
glimpses she could catch of the brilliantly
lighted house, Mary held her breath and clasped
her hands as she gazed out on the stage where,
across the soft green, from among the forest
trees, into the twilighted opening, glided the
fairies; waving their little arms, tripping slowly
as if half-poised for flight, listening, bending,
swaying, whirling, faster, swifter, they broke
into "The Grand Spectacular Ballet of the
Fairies," as the advertisements of the opera
phrased it. Faster, swifter still, noiselessly
they spun, here, there, in, out, in bewildering
maze until, as the red and yellow lights cast
upon the stage changed into green, their
footsteps slackened, faltered, their heads,
like tired flowers, drooped, and each on its
mossy bank of green,&mdash;the fairies sank to
sleep.</p>

<p>All? All but one; one was left, in whose
baby mind was fixed an unfaltering supposition
that she must dance, as she had done alone,
over and over again at the rehearsals for her
tiny benefit, until the music stopped. So,
while Norma Bonkowski wrung her hands and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the stage manager swore, and all behind the
scenes was confusion and dismay, the Angel
danced on.</p>

<p>The prima donna whose place it now was,
as the forsaken princess, lost in the forest, to
happen upon the band of sleeping fairies, waited
at her entrance, watching the child as, catching
and spreading her fan-like skirts of gauze, she
bent, swayed, flitted to and fro, her eyes big
and earnest with intentness to duty, her yellow
hair flying, all unconscious, in the fierce glare
of the colored lights, of the sea of faces in the
house before her.</p>

<p>With a sudden flash of intuition Norma Bonkowski
flew to the manager. "Stop the music,
make them stop," she begged.</p>

<p>He glared at her savagely, but nevertheless
communicated the order to the orchestra, and
as the music waned to a mere wailing of the
violin, the little dancer, rosy, hot, tired, whirled
slower, slower,&mdash;then sank on her bed of green,
and like her companions feigned sleep with the
cunning pretence of childhood.</p>

<p>But not even then could the prima donna
make her appearance, for, in the storm of ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>plause
which followed, the revived efforts of
the orchestra were drowned.</p>

<p>The face of the manager broadened into
smiles, Norma Bonkowski fell against Mary
Carew with tears of relief, and the prima donna
with good-natured readiness stepped upon the
stage, lifted the now frightened child who, at
the noise, had sprung up in alarm, and carried
her out to the footlights, the other children
peeping, but too well drilled, poor dears, to
otherwise stir. The audience paused.</p>

<p>"Wave bye-bye to the little girl over there,"
whispered the prima donna with womanly readiness,
nodding toward the nearest box, filled
with children eagerly enjoying "The Children's
Opera of the Princess Blondina and the Fairies."</p>

<p>Though frightened and ready to cry, the
Angel waved her hand obediently, and the
prima donna, nodding and smiling in the unaffected
fashion which was half her own charm,
carried the child off the stage amid applause as
enthusiastic as she herself was used to receiving.</p>

<p>It had all taken place in a very few minutes,
but as the smiling singer said, handing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Angel over to the manager, even in those few
moments, "She has made the hit of the season,"
then, turning, re-entered the stage, her voice,
with its clear bell-like tones, filling the house
with the song, "Blondina Awakening The
Fairies."</p>

<p>Nor did it end with this, for the Angel was
forthwith engaged, at what seemed to Norma
and Mary a fabulous price, to repeat her solo
dance at every Wednesday and Saturday matin&eacute;e
during the further run of the opera.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE ANGEL RESCUES MR. TOMLIN.</span></h2>

<p>It was on the afternoon that Mary carried
back her week's completed work that Norma,
receiving an unexpected summons to the Opera
House, was obliged, though with many misgivings,
to leave the Angel in the charge of Joey.
"But what else could I do," she reasoned afterward,
"with Mrs. O'Malligan out and Mrs. Tomlin
sick, and nobody else willing, it appeared,
to see to her?"</p>

<p>True, she had cautioned Joey, over and over
again about keeping the child away from the
window, and about staying right in the room
until her return; but, notwithstanding, Norma
could hardly have gotten to the corner before
Joey, promptly forgetting his promise, and
finding the room a dull playground, was enticing
his charge into the hall and straightway
down the stairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>At the bottom of the second flight, the two
children came upon Mr. Tomlin entertaining
two gentlemen callers. Only the week before,
the Tenement had been called upon to mourn
with the Tomlins, whose baby had been carried
away in a little coffin after the fashion of tenement
babies when the thermometer climbs up
the scale near to one hundred. And since then,
Mrs. Tomlin, refusing to be comforted, had
taken to her bed, thus making it necessary for
her husband to receive his company in the hall.</p>

<p>The callers, who, together with their host,
were sitting on the steps, moved aside to
allow the children to pass. The larger of the
gentlemen was unpleasantly dirty, with a ragged
beard and a shock of red hair. The other was
a little man with quick black eyes and a pleasant
smile. Passing these by, the Angel paused
on the step above Mr. Tomlin and slipped her
arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Pick a back, my Tomlin," she sweetly commanded
in the especially imperious tones she
reserved for Mr. Tomlin's sex, "get up, horsey."</p>

<p>The good-natured giant, for such her Tomlin
was, shouldered her as one would some precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
burden liable to break, grinned, stood up and
obediently trotted the length of the hall and
back.</p>

<p>Joey, meanwhile, legs apart, stood eyeing
the visitors attentively. "Keep up that kind
of talk," the dirty gentleman was urging, "and
we've got him. He's worth any three of ordinary
strength, and he's a favorite with the
men, too."</p>

<p>Here the horse and his rider returned.
"What a got in a pocket for Angel?" the
young autocrat proceeded to demand when lifted
down. Of all her masculine subjects in the
Tenement, Mr. Tomlin was her veriest slave.</p>

<p>He produced a soiled but gay advertising
picture. Her ladyship put out her hand. "But
you must give us a dance fer it," coaxed Mr.
Tomlin, anxious to display the talent of the
Tenement. "She's the young 'un as dances at
the Op'ry House, the kid is," he explained to
his visitors, "they've had her pictoor in the
papers, too. Miss Bonkowski, the chorus-lady
upstairs, she's got one of them, came out in a
Sunday supplement, though I can't say I see
the likeness myself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>At this, the two gentlemen, who had seemed
decidedly bored than otherwise at the interruption,
deigned to bestow a moment of their attention
upon the beautiful child in the faded
gingham dress.</p>

<p>"She got skeered to the theyater the other
day," put in Joey, "an' most cried when they
clapped so, an' they promised her anything she
wanted if she wouldn't next time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And her didn't cwy," declared the baby,
turning a pair of indignantly reproachful eyes
upon Joey, "her danced, her didn't cwy."</p>

<p>"Ain't yer goin' to dance fer us now?"
coaxed Mr. Tomlin.</p>

<p>"No," said the Angel naughtily, then relenting
at sight of her Tomlin's face, "her'll sing,
her won't dance."</p>

<p>The pleasant gentleman, thinking, perhaps
to please Mr. Tomlin, or maybe to get rid of
them the sooner, produced a red ribbon
badge. "Ef ze will sing," he said, showing
his white teeth as he smiled, "ze shall hav
it."</p>

<p>Turning to view this new party, her ladyship
treated him to a brief examination, but evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>dently
approving of him, began to sing with
no more ado:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Je suis si l'enfant gat&eacute;<br />
<span class="poem1">Tra la la la, tra la la,</span><br />
Car je les aime les petits pat&eacute;s.<br />
<span class="poem1">Et les confitures,</span><br />
Si vous voulez me les donner<br />
Je suis tr&egrave;s bien oblig&eacute;,<br />
<span class="poem1">Tra la la la, tra la la,</span><br />
<span class="poem1">Tra la la la, tra la la."</span></p>

<p>Only a word here and there could have been
intelligible, but their effect upon the pleasant
gentleman was instantaneous. He broke into a
torrent of foreign exclamations and verbosity,
showing his teeth and gesticulating with his
hands.</p>

<p>A strange light came into the baby's face
and she held out her arms to the little man
entreatingly. "Oui, oui," she cried, a spot of
red burning on each cheek, "you take Angel to
her mamma, take Angel to her mamma!"</p>

<p>But here the door of the Tomlin's room
opened hastily, and the neighbor who was
sitting with the sick woman thrust out her
head. "She's talkin' mighty wild an' out her
head," she said, "you'd better come to her."</p>

<p>Mr. Tomlin rose hastily, while the dark little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
man, yielding to the child's entreaties, took her
in his arms.</p>

<p>But the red-headed gentleman laid a dirty
hand on Mr. Tomlin's arm. "Just as I was
saying," he said, as if resuming a broken-off
conversation, "no doctor, no medicine. Why?
No work, no wages. Why? The heel of the
rich man grinding the poor to the earth."</p>

<p>Mr. Tomlin hesitated.</p>

<p>"It's entirely a meeting of Union men. No
violence advocated. A mass-meeting to discuss
appointing committees to demand work."</p>

<p>"Ze outcry of ze oppressed," put in the
pleasant gentleman, looking out from behind
the Angel's fair little head, and showing his
white teeth in his smile, "in zer union ees
zere only strength."</p>

<p>Mr. Tomlin's door opened still more violently.
"She's a-beggin' as you'll get her some ice,"
announced the neighbor, "she says she's burnin'
up."</p>

<p>"God A'mighty!" burst forth the giant, "I
ain't got a cent on earth to get her nothin',"
and he turned toward the two men fiercely, his
great brows meeting over his sullen eyes, "yes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
I'll come, you can count on me," and he went
in the door.</p>

<p>"Liberty Square by the statue, four o'clock,"
called the dirty gentleman after him, while the
pleasant gentleman put the Angel hastily down.
"Adieu, mon enfant," he cried, showing his
teeth as he smiled back over his shoulder, and
followed his companion down the stairs.</p>

<p>In time Joey and his weeping charge also
reached the bottom. Not a word of the conversation
had escaped the sharp ears of the
Major. "It's past two, now," he soliloquized,
"an' he said Liberty Square, four o'clock. I
know where the statoo is. Yer follows the cars
from front of th' arm'ry an' they goes right
there, 'cause that's where the Cap'n's office is.
Don'tcher cry no more, Angel," with insinuating
coaxing in his tones, "I'll take yer there if
yer wanter go."</p>

<p>The Angel slipped her hand in his obediently,
and the two forthwith proceeded to leave the
neighborhood of the Tenement behind them,
undeterred by the friendly overtures of Petey
O'Malligan and his colleagues to join in with
their pastimes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ain't got no time fer foolin'," confided
Joey, hurrying her along, "there'll be flags an'
hollerin', an' we wanter get there in time."</p>

<p>On reaching the car line the small Major was
obliged to slacken his speed, for, while, in a
measure, the Angel had caught the spirit of his
enthusiasm, yet her legs refused to keep pace
with his haste.</p>

<p>"Ef yer was still ter heaven, Angel," the
Major pondered, as they stood on the street
corner getting breath, "yerz wouldn't need ter
use yer legs at all, would yer? Yer'd jus' take
out an' fly across this yere street, waggins an'
trucks an' all, wouldn't yer?"</p>

<p>The Angel cast her eyes upon him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That's what my mammy tol' me about
Angels," Joey declared stoutly.</p>

<p>"Angel didn't a never fly," nevertheless the
baby stated with conviction.</p>

<p>Joey looked disappointed, and even unconvinced.
Then his face brightened. "That's
'cause you was too little, like that canary at th'
Res't'rant what ain't got its feathers yet. You
was too little fer yer wings to have growed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
afore you come away," and his lively imagination
having thus settled the problem, the two
continued their way.</p>

<p>"Yer see how it is," he observed presently,
evidently having been revolving the subject in
his busy brain, "ef Mis' Tomlin had th' doctor
an' some ice, she'd get well, she would, an'
Mr. Tomlin, he's goin' to this yere meetin' to
see about work, so's he can get 'em fer her.
But 'tain't no use fer workin' men to beg for
work these yere days," he added with a comical
air of wisdom. "I heerd Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. say, I
did, to a man what comes ter talk politics wid
him, that beggin' th' rich people to help yer
was jus' like buttin' yer head agin a brick wall,
so what good's it goin' ter do if he does
go?"</p>

<p>The Angel nodded amiably, and slipped her
hand in Joey's that she might the better keep
up. They had passed the region of small shops
and were passing through a better portion of
the city. Before a tall stone house, one of a
long row, a girl stood singing, while a boy
played an accompaniment on a harp. As Joey
and his charge reached them, a lady, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
group of children clustered about her, threw
some pennies out the window to the young
musicians.</p>

<p>"Did yer see that, Angel," demanded Joey,
"did yer ketch onter that little game? We
c'n do that. I c'n whis'le an' you c'n sing, an'
we'll make 'nough to get Mis' Tomlin th' ice
ourselves. If yer do," continued the wily Joey,
"I tell yer what,&mdash;we'll go home on the cable
cars, we will." And he hurried his small companion
along the sunny sidewalks, still following
the line of the cable cars, until they came
to a business street again, this time of large
and handsome stores. Here, before the most
imposing, Joey paused, and cast a calculating
eye upon the stream of shoppers passing in and
out. "Now, Angel, sing," he commanded.</p>

<p>The footsore, tired Angel, hot and cross, declined
to do it. "Her wants to sit down an'
west," she declared.</p>

<p>"We'll sit down out there on ther curbstone
an' rest soon as yer sing some," promised the
Major. So, taking up their stand on the flagging
outside the entrance of the big store, the
bare-headed Angel, in her worn gingham frock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
highbred and beautiful as a little princess,
despite it, struck up with as much effect as
a bird's twitter might make. Finding that his
whistle in no way corresponded to the song,
Joey wisely contented himself with holding
out his soldier's cap.</p>

<p>Two such babies, one with so innocent, and
the other with so comically knowing a smile,
could not but attract attention. Some laughed,
some sighed, some stopped to question, many
dropped pennies and some put nickels, and
even a dime or two into Joey's cap, while one
stout and good-humored woman opened the
paper bag she carried and put a sponge cake
in each hand. But at this point, seeing that
the policeman in charge of the crossing had
more than once cast a questioning eye upon
them, Joey decided to move on. "We'll have
ter hurry anyhow," he observed, "ter get to
ther speakin' in time. If you'll come on,
Angel, 'thout restin', I'll tell yer what,&mdash;I'll
buy yer a banana, I will, first ones we see."
And the weary Angel, thus beguiled, dragged
her tired feet along in Joey's wake.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The slanting rays from the setting sun were
falling across Liberty Square, on the statue of
that great American who declared all men to
be created equal, on the sullen faces of hundreds
of idle men who stood beneath its
shadow, listening to speech after speech from
various speakers, speeches of a nature best calculated
to coax the smouldering resentment in
their hearts into a blaze.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the park-like square a
small boy was urging a smaller girl to hurry.
"Angel's legs won't go no more," the diminutive
female was wailing as her companion
dragged her along.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the impassioned words of the last
oration were being echoed and emphasized by
mutterings and imprecations. The mob, in
fact, was beginning to respond, just as its promoters
had intended that it should, and as
their dangerous eloquence continued to pour
forth, the emotions of the crowd accordingly
grew fiercer, louder, until from sullen mutterings,
the applauding echoes grew to clamor
and uproar. And following the impassioned
harangue of the last speaker upon the program<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>&mdash;a
red-haired gentleman, unpleasantly dirty&mdash;the
cheers gave place to groans, the groans grew
to threats, to curses, and the confusion spread
like the roar of a coming storm.</p>

<p>Suddenly above the noise, came the measured
tramp of feet. In the momentary lull
succeeding, "The police, the police," a voice
rang out on the silence, and the single cry
swelled to a roar from hundreds of throats,
and as suddenly died away to an expectant
silence. At that a voice, loud with authority,
rang out upon the stillness, "In the name of
the Commonwealth," the measured words declared,
"I command you to immediately and
peaceably disperse!"</p>

<p>The answer came in a chorus of jeers, hoots,
yells of derision, and the howling mob began
to seize whatever promised to be a weapon
of defense or attack. Growing in numbers as
dusk fell, the crowd now was spreading back
into the surrounding streets. Merchants who
had not already done so, were hurriedly closing
their stores. The cars were blocked, and foot
travellers fleeing in all directions. From the
thickest of the crowd, a mighty creature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
bone and muscle, a giant in height and breadth,
grasping an iron support twisted from a bench,
had forced his way out to the street, and now
was using it to pry up the bricks from the
sidewalk, which in turn were seized by his
companions.</p>

<p>Above the uproar and confusion the voice of
authority, ringing out its words of command,
was heard again.</p>

<p>Head and shoulders above the crowd, the
giant stood erect, waving his iron bar above
his head. "At 'em, men," he cried, "at 'em
before they fire!"</p>

<p>But as he paused, another cry arose, a
frightened, childish wail, that came from a
very diminutive female clinging to his knees.
"My Tomlin," it cried.</p>

<p>The giant's arm dropped, and as the crowd
swept on and left him standing, Mr. Tomlin
looked down to behold the Angel, and holding
fast to her, the badly frightened but defiant
personage of Joey.</p>

<p>The giant caught the Angel up in his arms.
"Hold on to my coat," he cried to Joey, and
speedily, such of the crowd as had not swept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
by in their charge against the police, fell back
on either side before Mr. Tomlin's mighty fist.
Fighting desperately, he reached the edge,
and seizing Joey, dragged him across the car
tracks as the crash of stones, the breaking of
glass, the sharp crack of firearms, told of the
meeting of the forces behind him.</p>

<p>Howls of rage, of pain, of defiance answered,
followed by further crashing of stones and
splintering of glass in street lights and car
windows, and not until they were several
squares removed from the scene of action did
Mr. Tomlin pause. He then laid a heavy hand
on Joey. "By all that's&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But Joey was ready for him, and hastily began
to pour his earnings from his jacket pocket
in a pile upon the flagging. "Me an' Angel
made it a-singin' on the street fer to get ice fer
Mis' Tomlin," the wily one explained. And
the tender-hearted giant, gazing from one
small figure to the other, forthwith began to
sob like a child.</p>

<p>And, oh, the rejoicings of the distracted
Tenement when the lost Angel was returned!
And how Joey was seized and violently threat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ened
to be as violently forgiven. Mrs. Tomlin,
given ice to her heart's content, fell asleep,
blessing the Angel for having rescued her husband
from the almost certain hands of the law.
And when, next day, it was learned that various
and sundry of Mr. Tomlin's friends, among
them the red-haired gentleman and his dark
companion, had been arrested, while Mr. Tomlin
was safe at home, the Angel became more
than ever the pride and idol of the Tenement.</p>

<p>"There's some'n' mighty wrong," Mr. Tomlin
was heard arguing soon after, "for a man
with the bone and muscle to 'em as I've got,
wantin' work an' willin' to do anything, yet
havin' to starve&mdash;but whatever it is as is wrong,
I'm thinkin' mobs ain't the way to right
it."</p>

<p>"An' if he'd only hed th' sinse to make the
furrin' gintleman as could talk the gibberish to
question th' Angel choild," said Mrs. O'Malligan
indignantly, "sure an' we moight have
larned all about her by this toime, entoirely,
for there's mony a thing she's tried to tell us
an' can't for the want of a worrud. But foind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
me a man of yer as does any thinkin' 'thout
his woman there to prompt him," she quoth
contemptuously, "an' I'll foind ye a polaceman
as isn't a meddler in other folks' affairs, as this
yere mob is jist anither provin' of."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE MAJOR SUPERINTENDS THE ANGEL'S
EDUCATION.</span></h2>

<p>"It's a nice, cool morning," said the ever
sanguine Miss Bonkowski to Joey, one day
late in September, "so, if you will give me
your solemn promise&mdash;" and Miss Norma
paused impressively, emphasizing her words
with nods of her blonde head, "not to go to
any speakings, nor yet to the dock to fish, nor
to any fires, or to a procession, even if it's
right around the corner," and Miss Norma
drew breath as she finished the enumerating of
his various exploits, "why, Angel here can
play with you until Mary Carew comes down
to get her."</p>

<p>The Major&mdash;his cap a little more battered,
his belt somewhat the worse from constant
wear, but clean as to face and hands, having
just emerged from the morning inspection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the Armory janitor, better known to the neighborhood
as Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.&mdash;treated Miss Bonkowski
to a salute and a confidential wink, and
edged up to the smiling Angel's side. "Yer
jus' leave her wid me," he responded reassuringly,
"an' I ain't goin' to do nothin' as ain't
square."</p>

<p>And Miss Norma, whose faith in human
nature, ph&#339;nix-like, ever sprang up anew from
the blighted hopes of former trust, accordingly
turned her darling over to Joey and hurried off.
"For she's obliged to have some one to play
with and to get some fresh air somehow," the
chorus-lady argued for her own re-assuring,
though it remains a mystery as to how she
could deceive herself into considering the garbage-scented
atmosphere of the neighborhood
as fresh, "and Joey's by far the best of the
lot around here."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the small subject of all this solicitude,
in clean frock and smiling good-humor,
responded at once to Joey's proposal, and the
two sat down on the curbstone. In the constant
companionship of their two months'
acquaintance, the little Major's growing inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>est
in the Angel had assumed almost fatherly
proportions. Hitherto this zeal had taken itself
out in various expeditions for her entertainment
similar to the one ending in Mr.
Tomlin's rescue. To-day it was produced in
the shape of a somewhat damaged peach purchased
with a stray penny. But the Angel, in
her generous fashion, insisting on a division
of the dainty, Joey at first stoutly declining,
weakened and took half, seeing to it, however,
that his was the damaged side.</p>

<p>"When yer was up there," he observed
unctiously as he devoured his portion&mdash;and he
nodded his round little head toward that foggy
and smoky expanse about them, popularly believed
by the population about the Tenement
to be the abode of angels&mdash;"when yer was up
there, yer had these kinder things every day,
didn't yer?"</p>

<p>If her small ladyship's word could be taken
for it, in that other life still remembered by
her, she had everything, even to hoky-poky ad
libitum, to her heart's content, though her
testimony framed itself into somewhat more
halting and uncertain English.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did yer do up there, anyhow?"
queried Joey curiously.</p>

<p>"Danced," the Angel declared, daintily devoting
herself to her portion of the peach,
"her danced and&mdash;her danced."</p>

<p>This earthly vocation seemed to fail to appeal
to Joey's imagination. "Nothin' else?"
he demanded anxiously. "Didn't yer never
do nothin' else?"</p>

<p>But the Angel had fallen to poking the green
contents of the gutter with a stick, and seemed
to find the present more fascinating to contemplate
than the past.</p>

<p>"Didn't yer never go nowhere?" persisted
Joey.</p>

<p>"Her went to school," the Angel admitted,
or so it sounded to Joey.</p>

<p>"What 'ud yer do at school?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Danced," was the Angel's unmistakable
announcement.</p>

<p>Joey looked disgusted, but soon recovered
and fell to revolving a new idea in his fertile
young brain.</p>

<p>"I know where there is a school," he remarked.
"I've never went, but I hung on ter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the window-sill an' looked in, an' if yer went
ter school up there, yer oughter be goin' down
here, see!" And forthwith Joey arose.</p>

<p>Amiable as her small ladyship usually was,
on this occasion, seeing determination written
on Joey's small countenance, she rebelled.
"Angel yants to stay here," the young lady
declared, continuing to poke at the contents
of the gutter.</p>

<p>"I don't wanter make her cry," argued Joey
wisely, then cast about in his mind for an inducement.
"They have parties to that school,
they do," finally he observed, "fer I seen 'em
settin' 'round tables an' eatin' one day."</p>

<p>The guileless infant rose to the bait at once,
and dropped her stick and slipped her confiding
hand in Joey's. "Angel likes to have parties,"
she declared, and thus lured on, she forthwith
followed Joey down the street.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>"Some one to see me," repeated pretty
Miss Stannard, of the Darcy College Settlement's
Free Kindergarten, and laying down
her blocks she went to the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>On the steps outside the entrance stood a
small, chubby-cheeked boy smiling up out of
knowing brown eyes from beneath a soldier's
cap many sizes too large for him, while behind
him stood a slender, graceful child with wonderful
shining hair, and eyes equally as smiling.</p>

<p>The small boy treated the tall, pretty young
lady to a most confiding nod and a wink.
"I've brought her ter school," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, have you?" returned the young lady
laughing, "then I'd better invite you in, I suppose,"
and she led the way toward the entry-room
where hung some dozens of shabby hats
and bonnets. "And what is your name?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Her name is Angel, it is," responded the
little fellow briskly, with emphasis on the pronoun,
as if to let the young lady understand at
once that her interest need extend no further
than to the prospective pupil.</p>

<p>"Didn't a know I are Angel?" queried the
smiling cherub with her accustomed egotistical
surprise.</p>

<p>"And what is your other name?" questioned
Miss Stannard smiling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"She ain't got no more," returned the escort
succinctly.</p>

<p>"And what is yours?"</p>

<p>"Mine&mdash;oh, I'm just the Major, I am," with
off-hand loftiness.</p>

<p>"Indeed? And where do you live, Major?"</p>

<p>"Fourth Reg'ment Arm'ry," responded the
Major glibly.</p>

<p>"And the little girl,&mdash;Angel&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Major looked somewhat surprised,
"They come from Heaven,&mdash;Angels do, yer
know," he remarked, staring a little at the tall
young lady's want of such knowledge.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the pretty lady gently,
"but where is she living now?"</p>

<p>"Round by me," said the small boy briefly,
showing some restlessness.</p>

<p>"With her father and mother?"</p>

<p>The Major, staring again, shook his head,
and poor Miss Stannard, despairing, of learning
anything definite from this source, asked if he
would take her there after Kindergarten, and
began to untie the little girl's cap.</p>

<p>Evidently gratified at this attention to his
charge, the Major said that he would, and fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>lowed
the two into the large, sunny room adjoining.
"The children are just going on the
circle," said the pretty young lady, "won't you
take my other hand and go too."</p>

<p>The Major drew back hastily. "She's come
ter school," he declared indicating the Angel,
"there ain't no school in it fer me. I'm a
sojer, I am."</p>

<p>"Then have a chair, sir, and watch us," said
the young lady, with amused eyes, as she
brought out a little red chair with polite hospitality.</p>

<p>The young gentleman graciously accepting
it, the Angel was forthwith borne away to join
the circle of children about the ring, and to
Miss Stannard's surprise, with no more ado,
joined in the game like one familiar with it all,
waving her small hands, singing gaily and,
when her turn arrived, flitting gaily about
the circle until the sash strings of her
little faded dress sailed straight out behind
her.</p>

<p>And the game at an end, without waiting
for direction or guidance, the newcomer
marched with the other children about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
big room and took her place with them at one
of the tables spread with entrancing green and
yellow papers. And here, absorbed in directing
the work at her own table, and her two
assistant teachers equally absorbed at theirs,
Miss Stannard was presently aroused by a
nudge from 'Tildy Peggins, the freckle-faced
young person employed in a capacity of janitress
and nursery maid.</p>

<p>"Look a-yonder to that young willain, Miss
Ruth," urged 'Tildy, whose sentiments regarding
the infant populace refused, despite all the
efforts of her employers, to be tempered by
Kindergarten views.</p>

<p>Miss Stannard looked up hastily, and so did
the twenty pairs of eyes about her table.</p>

<p>From the depths of one pocket the Major
had produced a cigarette, and from the mixed
contents of another he had extracted a match,
and as the twenty pairs of eyes fell on him, a
fascinating curl of blue smoke was just issuing
from his lips.</p>

<p>'Tildy Peggins folded her arms on her flat
chest and gave vent to a groan. Already, with
her gloomy views on Kindergarten regeneration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
versus innate depravity, she foresaw the contamination
of every half-subjugated small masculine
in the room.</p>

<p>Miss Stannard, with a shake of her head at
'Tildy, coughed slightly. Instantly the eyes
of the school left the Major and fixed themselves
expectantly on her pretty face.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted to be a soldier,
Major," she observed, addressing the small
gentleman.</p>

<p>"I is goin' to be," returned that unabashed
gentleman, calmly sticking a thumb in his belt,
and in so doing pushing his jacket aside, so as to
further expose the military trappings about his
round little person, "I's a-goin' to be a sojer in
the Fourth Regiment."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Miss Ruth, "the members
of the Fourth Regiment are gentlemen,
and a gentleman would never have smoked in
here without asking if he might."</p>

<p>The Major looked somewhat moved out of
his usual imperturbability. The curl of offending
smoke ceased.</p>

<p>"I know a soldier," Miss Ruth went on
calmly, "and what is more, he is a member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the Fourth Regiment, but he never would have
done such a thing as you are doing."</p>

<p>The cigarette trembled in the Major's irresolute
fingers.</p>

<p>"And even if you had asked first," the
steady voice went on, "I would have said no,
for such a thing as smoking is never allowed in
this room."</p>

<p>The Major's irresolute brown eyes met Miss
Stannard's resolute brown ones. Then the
cigarette went out the open window behind
him and the work at the tables went on.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Ruth looked up again.
"Won't you come," she said pleasantly, touching
a pile of the gay papers. "Are you not
tired?"</p>

<p>The Major shook his head decidedly. "No,
he would not," and finding a chip among the
apparently inexhaustible stores of his pockets,
he next produced a knife boasting an inch of
blade and went to whittling upon 'Tildy's immaculate
floor.</p>

<p>Miss Ruth saw it all, and presently saw the
chip fall to the floor and the round head begin
to nod. Then, with 'Tildy Peggins' gloomy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and disapproving eye upon her at this act of
overture, she crossed the room. "Major,"
said Miss Ruth, just a little plaintively, perhaps,
"do you suppose you could do something
for me?"</p>

<p>The Major was wide awake on the instant.</p>

<p>"These papers," explained Miss Ruth, while
'Tildy from her work of washing windows,
shook her disapproving head, "put all like this
in a pile on the table here, and all like this over
here, and this color,&mdash;here," and before Miss
Stannard had gotten over to her table again,
the Major was deep in the seductive fascinations
of Kindergarten.</p>

<p>It was when the three teachers, with 'Tildy's
help, had at last distributed the sixty hats,
hoods, and caps, and started the loitering
groups on their homeward ways, that pretty
Miss Stannard, putting on her own hat, addressed
her new pupils. "Now, Major, I am
ready," she said, and the three accordingly
turned their steps toward the neighborhood of
the Tenement.</p>

<p>Miss Ruth's small escort had quite an idea
of the proper thing to do, and pointed out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
landmarks as the three went along, the
Angel's friendly hand slipped confidingly into
that of her new friend.</p>

<p>"I did hear as so many died in this yere
house of the fevers this summer," Joey remarked
cheerfully, pointing to a wretched-looking
tenement building they were passing;
"they'll give yer a room there now fer nothin'
to git a good name fer the house agin."</p>

<p>Miss Ruth shivered as they passed.</p>

<p>The Major next nodded toward a dingy
saloon. "Here's where I take a schooner an'
a free lunch sometimes," he remarked confidentially.</p>

<p>The tall young lady's brown eyes danced as
she glanced down at the small person of the
Major. "And how old are you, Major?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Ha'f pas' seven, the Cap'n an' Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.,
they say."</p>

<p>"The Captain? Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.?"</p>

<p>"Uh, huh! The Cap'n's a good 'un, he is.
He gim' me these yere togs, he did, an' he told
Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. I might sleep to th' Arm'ry,
see?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Ruth saw, and was just about to pursue
the subject of Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R., when the Angel
dropped her hand and with a gleeful cry ran
ahead, and Miss Stannard looked up to behold
two females bearing down upon them. Miss
Bonkowski and Mrs. O'Malligan in fact, nor
did they pause in their haste, until the Angel
was safe in Norma's embrace and the Major
anything but safe, in the clutches of the irate
Irish lady.</p>

<p>"An' it's yerself, ye limb, an' plaze to tell us
whut ye mane by it?" the loud-voiced Mrs.
O'Malligan demanded, "a-runnin' off with
the childer agin, an' the whole Tiniment out
huntin' an' her niver to be found at all, at
all?"</p>

<p>But the sweet-faced, tall young lady coming
to his rescue, the two women softened, and
reaching the Tenement, insisted on Miss Stannard
coming in, and hearing the Angel's story.</p>

<p>And on the way up to Miss Bonkowski's
apartment, she learned that the Tenement, that
morning, had been convulsed from cellar to
garret, by the great honor bestowed upon it.
For who but the Prima Donna, the Great Per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>sonage
of Norma's professional world, had just
driven away in her carriage after a visit of an
hour and the Angel never to be found at all!</p>

<p>"An' ma'am," explained Mary Carew, her
bony face swollen with crying, when Miss Stannard
had been installed in one of the two chairs
of the apartment, "an' ma'am, it was fer th'
Angel she come. A offerin' Norma an' me
anything we'd name to give her up, such a
fancy as she's taken to her, an' wantin' her fer
her own."</p>

<p>"And you, what did you say?" asked Miss
Ruth, gently, watching Mary with tender eyes as
she held the beautiful, chattering little creature
so jealously in her arms, and thinking as she
watched, of the life and reputation commonly
accorded the great singer.</p>

<p>"Say?" came from Miss Bonkowski quickly,
her befrizzled blonde tresses fairly a-tremble
with her intensity, and sticking the hat-pin
recklessly in and out of the lace hat she had
taken off, "what did we say, you ask, and
knowing, as you and every body must, the kind
of life and future it would mean for a child
that takes to things like this 'n does! With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
all her money and her soft, winning ways, it is
better, far better, for the child with her disposition,
to starve along with Mary an' me, than
grow up to that, if it was nothing more to be
afraid of than being left to servants and hotel
people and dragged around from place to place
in such a life as it is. Not that I mean, ma'am,"
and Miss Bonkowski spoke with quick pride,
"that being in the profession need to make
any body what they shouldn't be, for I know
plenty of 'em of the best, and am one myself,
though only a Chorus, but what with what's
said about this one, even with her good heart
and generous ways, she's not the one to have
our Angel, though she meant it for the
best."</p>

<p>"An' she said," Mary Carew took it up, "as
how Norma's gettin' old, and 'll be dropped
afore long from the Chorus, an' she offered her,
she did, in this very room, a' here before me,
to buy out a Costumer as is leavin' the business,
an' start Norma in for herself, along of
her knowin' how to run a business such as
that."</p>

<p>"And oh girls," declared Miss Stannard as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
she told this part of the story to her assistant
teachers afterward, "it was the bravest thing
I've met among the poor people yet. Think
of the courage of those two women, with
poverty grimmer than they have yet known,
ahead of them in all probability, yet determined
to resist the temptation because they
are assured it is not well for the child. Picture
making jean pantaloons, year in, year out, at
barely living wages, yet having the courage to
put the matter so resolutely aside. After that,
I could not bring myself to tell them they had
done wrong in the beginning in not notifying
the authorities. Of course there is some mystery
about it. I cannot for a moment accept
their explanation of it. The child, beyond
question, is well born and has been carefully
trained. And she goes about among all the
strange, queer inmates of that Tenement house
as fearlessly as a little queen. But, oh, the one
that is a chorus-singer! If you could see her!
So lean, so sallow, so airy and full of manner.
But I will never laugh at another elderly
chorus-singer again in my life, she is grand, she's
heroic," and the pretty Kindergartner threaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
gay worsteds into needles with a vigor which
lent emphasis to her words.</p>

<p>"She's powerful stuck up, too," asserted the
gloomy tones of 'Tildy Peggins, and she shook
her mournful head, as she moved about straightening
the disordered room for the next day,
"there's a man lives in our Tenement wanted
to keep comp'ny with her, but, la, she tossed
her yellow head at his waffle cart, she did, an'
she said if he'd had a settled h'occupation she
might a thought about it in time, but she
couldn't bring herself to consider a perambulating
business, an' that was all there was to it.
La, maybe she is grand an' 'eroic, but she's
got a 'aughty 'eart, too, that woman has!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">MISS RUTH MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF
OLD&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.</span></h2>

<p>The Angel, as the cooler weather came on,
being suitably clothed by Miss Stannard and
the invisible though still generous Mrs. Tony,
and the good ladies of the Tenement seeing
that she was properly fed, her little ladyship
continued to thrive, and to pursue her way,
sweet and innocent, in the midst of squalor,
poverty and wickedness such as Mary and
Norma could not always hide, even from her
baby eyes.</p>

<p>True to the promise these ladies had made,
she appeared regularly at Kindergarten in the
charge of her faithful squire, the Major, whose
own interest in the daily work had never
flagged since the day he first agreed to help
Miss Stannard.</p>

<p>It was with surprise, therefore, that, late in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
November, Miss Ruth noted the absence of
the two for several successive days.</p>

<p>"Childern's obliged to get wore out fiddlin'
with beads an' paper an' such, in time," said
the perverse and unconverted 'Tildy Peggins.
"That's the reason they's constant droppin' off,
an' new ones comin' in. There ain't enough
willainy in Kindergarten to keep their minds
h'occupied. They's pinin' for the streets long
afore you'd h'ever believe it,&mdash;their 'earts ain't
satisfied with beads and paper, childern's obliged
to have a little willainy mixed in."</p>

<p>But despite 'Tildy's pessimistic views, on the
fifth morning of their absence, Miss Ruth had
just determined to send around to the Tenement,
when a knock summoned her to the
door.</p>

<p>Outside stood the smiling Angel, in her
little winter cloak and hood, her hand in that
of a very large, very grizzled, and very military-looking
man, who greeted Miss Stannard with
a salute reminding her at once of Joey.</p>

<p>"What has become of my friend, the
Major?" she inquired, ushering them into the
school-room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Joey couldn't come," explained the Angel,
mournfully.</p>

<p>"It was to tell you about him, ma'am, I
stepped around," replied the man, gazing admiringly
about the bright room, with its pictures,
its growing plants, its tables, and dozens
of little red chairs. "It is a pretty place now,
I must say, and it's no wonder the little chap
likes to come here. He's been that worried, and
fretting so about the little one not getting to
school, that I promised him I'd march her 'round
here every day if he'd call a halt on his fretting."</p>

<p>"He is sick, then?" Miss Ruth inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, it didn't seem as if it was enough to
lay him off duty," responded the man, as he
regarded Miss Ruth with friendly gaze; "he's
a knowin' little shaver, the Major is, and great
on tryin' to help me."</p>

<p>"Are you the friend that he calls Old G. A.
R.?" inquired Miss Ruth, with sudden intuition,
as she smiled back into the weather-beaten
face.</p>

<p>The old soldier chuckled. "He's told you
about that, has he? 'Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.!' Great
name, ain't it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why does he call you by it?"</p>

<p>"Grand Army of the Republic, ma'am. I'm
a member, and I reckon I do anecdote about
it overmuch at times. The Reg'ment round
there, they dubbed me that."</p>

<p>"And the Major?"</p>

<p>"That's right, ma'am, for'ard march! I'm
gettin' to it. He was in the Arm'ry with me,
the other day, a-pretendin' to help me clean
up, and he fell off one of the cannon he
was monkeyin' round. He didn't seem so
bad hurt, at first, but somehow, after I
come to think it over, he hasn't seemed to
want to move round since, so I lay it to
that."</p>

<p>"Have you had a doctor to see him?" asked
Miss Ruth, waving the groups of arriving children
on to 'Tildy's care.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I haven't. The officer that
took the fancy to the little chap and pays for
his eatin' along with me at the restaurant, he's
been out of town for six weeks, and after leaving
the baby here, I am on my way to his
office now, to see if he has got back," and he
stepped toward the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will take Angel home and stop by there
and see Joey," said Miss Ruth.</p>

<p>"We'll be happy to have you, ma'am," and
with a salute, the old soldier marched out the
door.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>"Indade, Miss Ruthie, an' it's proud I am to
go wid ye," said Mrs. O'Malligan some hours
later, in response to Miss Ruth's request to go
over to the Armory with her, "just ye wait till
I starts the Angel choild up the steps," and
Mrs. O'Malligan accordingly, was soon accompanying
Miss Ruth through the big door of
the Armory.</p>

<p>The old soldier met them and led the way
into a neat box of a room, very orderly, very
spotless. Here, on a cot, lay the Major, his
eyes turned to meet them expectantly. It was
quite pitiful to see how these few days had
changed him into the white little chap looking
up from the pillow.</p>

<p>"Well, Major," began Miss Ruth, cheerily,
and at sound of her bright, animated voice, a
figure in the shadow on the other side of the
cot looked up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Dilke," cried Miss Ruth, at sight
of the young and very properly attired gentleman
who stood up to greet her.</p>

<p>The young gentleman came round and shook
hands with evident pleasure. "So you are the
wonderful '<i>Teacher</i>,' Miss Stannard?"</p>

<p>"And you are the '<i>Cap'n</i>'?" retorted Miss
Ruth.</p>

<p>Here the Major, as he would have phrased
it, "caught on." "She said yer was a gentleman
what wouldn't a-smoked before ladies, she
did," volunteered Joey.</p>

<p>Miss Ruth blushed and laughed and blushed
again. "Well, he wouldn't, Joey," she reiterated
stoutly.</p>

<p>Whereupon the boyishly smooth face of Mr.
Dilke colored too, and being very big and
blonde and diffident, he blushed very red indeed,
while Joey, seeing something up, tried
to wink his roguish eyes but failed for very
weakness and found them full of tears instead.</p>

<p>"Where does it hurt?" asked Miss Ruth
gently, leaning over him.</p>

<p>The Major winked indignantly. "Sojers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
aint goin' to make no fuss if does hurt, Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. he says so!"</p>

<p>Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. in the background gave vent
to a sudden chuckle. "Obey your superior
officers, Major, afore anything," he corrected.</p>

<p>"Faith I'll jist take him in me lap an' say
whir he's hurted for meself," said Mrs. O'Malligan
briskly and forthwith laid her energetic
hand upon the little fellow. At her well meant
but rough handling, the child cried out, turning
white to the lips.</p>

<p>"Howly Mither, forgive me," cried Mrs.
O'Malligan.</p>

<p>Miss Ruth turned away to hide her tears.
"Have you had a doctor yet?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"No, I had just gotten here a moment ahead
of you," explained Mr. Dilke.</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Ruth, decidedly, "whether
it proves serious or not, he ought to go to St.
Luke's and be properly nursed, and if there
happens to be a free cot vacant, I will have no
trouble getting him in."</p>

<p>Mr. Dilke turned quickly. "Don't stop for
that," he said, "use me,&mdash;I mean,&mdash;don't let the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cost of it interfere,&mdash;I'll be very glad,&mdash;you
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Ruth beamed at the young man whom
she knew to be very rich indeed. "Just take
charge of a Free Kindergarten, Mr. Dilke, if
you ever really want to properly appreciate
your blessings and privileges," she said, "I am
never so sordid in my desire for wealth, as
when I stand helpless, with the knowledge of
the suffering around me, that money can
remedy or at least, alleviate."</p>

<p>"Let me walk with you to St. Luke's," begged
Mr. Dilke, "and you can tell me something
more about it all if you will." And
leaving Joey to Mrs. O'Malligan, until their
return, the two started off.</p>

<p>"You've evidently been very good to Joey,"
Miss Stannard remarked graciously, as they
went along.</p>

<p>Mr. Dilke blushed furiously, "Who? I?
No more than the other men in the Regiment.
Now a fellow could hardly help liking the little
chap, could he?" and he regarded his pretty
companion as if seeking justification in her
answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did it ever begin?" inquired Miss
Stannard.</p>

<p>"Through the old man&mdash;the janitor, you
know. The boy's mother was a daughter of a
dead soldier, comrade to Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. Good
for nothing husband, and that sort of thing,
you know, and always runnin' to Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.
for protection and help too, I suspect. When
she died, the old fellow didn't have the money,
and appealed to some of us fellows to help
bury her. And then, it turned out, here was
the boy. First we agreed to his staying at the
Armory a day or so, then a week, then longer,
and by that time the knowing little monkey
had made his own cause good. Here we are,&mdash;and
we'll just arrange, while here, to take a
doctor back with us."</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon that Miss Ruth,
having remained to see the Major safely asleep
after his removal to St. Luke's Hospital, came
down the steps of that institution with her
pretty eyes all dim with crying, the doctor's
words ringing in her ears, "Poor little chap,"
he had said, "it's merely a question of time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE ANGEL MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.</span></h2>

<p>A few days later Mrs. O'Malligan, in her
best attire, and Miss Bonkowski, also gotten
up regardlessly even to an added bloom upon
her cheeks, sallied forth in the face of the first
snowfall, to take the Angel to St. Luke's
Hospital, where, by appointment, Miss Ruth
was to meet them.</p>

<p>When in time they reached the building and
Miss Stannard led the way up to the Children's
Ward, a white-capped nurse came forward between
the rows of little beds each with its
child occupant, her finger on her lips. "He is
so much weaker to-day," she explained, "I
would say he had better not see any one,
except that he will fret, so please stay only a
few moments," and she led them to where
Joey lay, his white bed shut off from his little
neighbors by a screen. His eyes were closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and a young resident physician was standing
by the bed.</p>

<p>"We thought he was going for a while this
morning," whispered the nurse, but, low as she
spoke, the Major heard. A ghost of a twinkle
was in his brown eyes as they opened and
sought the doctor's. "I fooled 'em that time,
didn't I, Doc?" he demanded, and one trembling
lid attempted its old-time wink.</p>

<p>"You wanted Angel, Joey dear," said Miss
Ruth, "and she has come to see you."</p>

<p>The Angel's face was full of doubt and
trouble, her eyes dark with gathering tears.
Frightened at this something she half-divined,
but could not understand, she drew near
doubtfully. "Angel loves her Joey, her does,"
she asserted, however, as if in refutation of her
fears.</p>

<p>"Show her&mdash;my&mdash;gun," whispered Joey, and
from the table where his eyes could feast upon
it, the nurse lifted a small rifle.</p>

<p>"The Cap'n give it ter me,&mdash;so I could be a&mdash;member
of th' Reg'ment&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;see? Ain't
it a dandy&mdash;Angel?"</p>

<p>The child nodded gravely, but all the while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
her little breast was heaving with the gathering
sobs. Seeing Miss Norma also in tears, Miss
Ruth motioned her to take the Angel ahead,
and leaving Mrs. O'Malligan speaking to the
nurse, Miss Ruth followed slowly after, talking
with the doctor as she went.</p>

<p>A moment later, the ward was startled by
a cry from the hall beyond, "Yosie,&mdash;Angel's
Yosie!"</p>

<p>Miss Ruth and the doctor hurried out. In
the hall in a rolling chair sat a young woman
to whose knees the Angel was clinging, amid
sobs and little cooing cries of joy. "Yosie,
Angel's Yosie."</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" ejaculated the young doctor,
"this may lead to her identification. We do
not even know her name," he explained to Miss
Stannard. "A case of paralysis,&mdash;almost helpless.
Never has spoken since brought here.
Yes," in answer to Miss Ruth's eager inquiries,
"she has gotten so that she can make signs for
yes and no."</p>

<p>At once Miss Stannard turned to the girl,
from whose lap Norma was trying to draw the
expostulating Angel. "Do you know Angel?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
she asked, her hand on the child as she
spoke.</p>

<p>There was a slight affirmative droop to the
eyelids, while the gaze beneath was fixed imploringly
on Miss Ruth.</p>

<p>"Are you Rosy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My Yosie, it <i>is</i> my Yosie!" declared the
Angel, with one of her little bursts of baby rage,
pulling away from Norma and stamping her
foot, frantic that any doubt should exist.</p>

<p>At this point, Mrs. O'Malligan, who had
been following in her comfortable fashion,
unconscious of any excitement, drew near.
Suddenly there was an excited cry from that
lady. "Howly Mither, an' it's Mrs. Buckley's
own sister, Rosy O'Brien, fer sure!"</p>

<p>The wild eyes of the sick girl turned towards
Mrs. O'Malligan with signs of recognition.
The doctor repeated his story.</p>

<p>"She must have been Angel's nurse," said
Miss Stannard.</p>

<p>"An' was it the darlint's nurse ye war, Rosy
O'Brien?" inquired Mrs. O'Malligan.</p>

<p>"Yes," signalled the eyelids, whereupon
Mrs. O'Malligan, swaying her body to and fro,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and clapping her hands, burst forth suddenly,
"I say through wid it all, I say through wid it
all! Ye brought the Angel choild to the
Tiniment wid ye to say your sister, now, didn't
ye, Rosy, me jewel?"</p>

<p>The good Irish lady waited for the affirmative
droop from the eager eyes.</p>

<p>"An' maybe ye found the door locked, an'
not knowin' yer sister had moved away an'
Miss Johnson, what goes to the car stables
a-cleanin' by the day, livin' in her room now,
ye set the choild down in the empty room
a-nixt to it, an' run down to ask me as to whir
yer sister had gone, now, didn't ye, Rosy
O'Brien?" and Mrs. O'Malligan's garlanded
bonnet fell over one ear in the good soul's
excitement.</p>

<p>Thus far apparently she was right.</p>

<p>"An' I wasn't to home, for sure I niver seen
ye," ventured Mrs. O'Malligan, her hands now
on her hips as she gazed at the girl and pondered.</p>

<p>She was right again.</p>

<p>"An' what happened thin, I niver can say
no further!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor, referring to a note book, spoke
next. "She was brought here," he said, "on
the seventh of last July, about six o'clock in
the evening, having been knocked down by a
horse at the corner of Camden and Lisiden
Streets."</p>

<p>"Whist!" cried Mrs. O'Malligan, her shawl
fallen to the floor, her bonnet now hanging by
the strings down her back, "that's our own
corner, an' it's as plain to me now as the nose
on yer face! Not findin' me to home, ye were
runnin' over to the grocery to find out from
yer sister's husband's brother Bill whativer
had become of the family!"</p>

<p>The sharp Irish lady had hit it again, and
Miss Ruth here interrupted to ask Miss Bonkowski
if she could remember the date on which
the child had been found in the vacant room.
After some thought and debate, Miss Norma
declared it to have been on the morning of the
eighth of July, because her own birthday came
on the fifteenth and she remembered remarking
the child had then been with them a
week.</p>

<p>But here the whole party came to a stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>still,
and the wild, imploring look came back in
poor Rosy O'Brien's eyes.</p>

<p>The doctor laid his hand on her shoulder
reassuringly. "Don't fret, my girl, it will
all come right now in time. It is no
wonder," turning to Miss Stannard, "she has
been so slow getting better. I have said a
hundred times the girl had something on her
mind."</p>

<p>Miss Ruth turned to Rosy again. "Does
the child's mother, or do her people live here in
the city?" she inquired.</p>

<p>The eyelids failed to move, which according
to the doctor meant <i>no</i>.</p>

<p>"What will we do," sighed Miss Ruth, "for
the more the child is asked, the more perplexed
we get, and now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure an' we'll ask Mrs. Buckley, Rosy's
sister, an' she'll tell us all about it," said the
practical Mrs. O'Malligan. "I remember well
of her tellin' me of the foine wages Rosy was
a-gittin; along of her goin' off so fur wid some
rich lady as a nurse."</p>

<p>At this hopeful point the doctor interfered,
thinking best to prevent any further exciting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of his patient, and accordingly wheeled her
back to her ward, leaving the others to soothe
the terror of the child, at seeing hope vanish
with Rosy.</p>

<p>Pausing outside the big hospital in a trembling
and excited little group, Miss Stannard detailed
her plans. As the snow was coming
down steadily, Miss Bonkowski should return to
the Tenement at once with the excited, sobbing
child, and Mrs. O'Malligan should take
Miss Ruth to find Mrs. Buckley, the sister of
poor Rosy O'Brien.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>"And do you know," explained Miss Ruth
that evening, to Mr. Dilke, who had fallen
into a way of calling quite frequently indeed,
of late, "and do you know, this woman, this
Mrs. Buckley would not believe us, but insisted
that her sister, Rosy O'Brien, as well as the
child her sister had nursed, were drowned in
that terrible ferry-boat disaster last July.
After what seemed to me hours of catechising,
I got the story from her.</p>

<p>"A year ago, as I finally found out, her sister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
this same Rosy O'Brien, went South with a Mr.
and Mrs. De Leon Breaux, whose child she
had been nursing at Narragansett during the
summer.</p>

<p>"This spring, Mrs. Buckley, living then in
the Tenement where the child was afterward
found, received a letter from Rosy, saying she
would be in the city with her mistress for a few
days in July on their way to the seashore for
the summer.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile Mrs. Buckley moved, and being
unable to write, left her new address with Mrs.
O'Malligan. But the summer passing and no
Rosy appearing, in September Mrs. Buckley
grew anxious and got a friend to write to the
Breaux' address for her, inclosing a letter to
Rosy.</p>

<p>"In answer came a reply from Mr. Breaux,
which letter Mrs. Buckley showed me. It
stated that on the seventh of last July Rosy
O'Brien and the child, '<i>our little Angelique</i>,'
the letter called her, had been drowned while
crossing the river on the ferry.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Breaux and her young sister, with
Rosy O'Brien and the child, had reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
city the day before, having come by steamer
from New Orleans, their home.</p>

<p>"According to the statement of a waiter at
the hotel. Rosy, tired of waiting for the return
of the two ladies from a shopping expedition,
and having been promised the afternoon,
started off soon after lunch with the child, saying
that she was going across the river on the
ferry to see her sister. This was the last seen
of them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Breaux hurried North in response to
his wife's summons, and some days following
the ferry disaster, which occurred shortly after
the girl left the hotel, a body was found in the
river, which from its black cashmere dress,
white apron and plain gold ring, was identified
as that of poor Rosy.</p>

<p>"The girl had been taken on the recommendation
of a former mistress and, as so often
is the case, the Breaux' knew neither the name
nor the address of this sister, and having,&mdash;in
addition to the papers being filled with the
matter,&mdash;advertised in vain, the body was buried
and, despairing finally of recovering their child's
body, they returned South. Though don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
think," said pretty Ruth suddenly regarding
Mr. Dilke's attentive face while she laughed,
"that I received the story from Mrs. Buckley
in any such direct fashion. Such people are not
only illogical and irrelevant, they are secretive,&mdash;if
ever you have to do with them as my work
leads me to, you'll understand what I mean.
But to continue with Mrs. Buckley. In order
to convince her that neither Rosy nor the child,
despite her evidence, were dead, I took her
straight back to the hospital, and as she then
admitted Rosy to be Rosy, any lingering doubts
were put at rest. And now you see why I was
so relieved when you came this evening.
Mother has no better business head than I
have, and I want you to help me determine
how best to let these Breaux know the child is
alive."</p>

<p>But Mr. Dilke, though far from a stupid
young man, confessed himself a little dazed by
Miss Ruth's rapid and excited story. Whereupon,
laughing, she went over it again, adding,
"And here is the address and the name is De
Leon Breaux, and how shall we word the telegram?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>And after much speculation the following
was written and sent:</p>

<p class="letter">
"Nurse-girl, Rose O'Brien, found in hospital, paralyzed.  Child
safe and well.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap"><span class="letter1">"Van Alstine Dilke,</span><br />
<span class="letter2">"Hotel St. George."</span></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">MARY CAREW IS TEMPTED.</span></h2>

<p>When Norma, on reaching home with the
tired child, finished her story, which, truth to
tell, lost nothing of its dramatic possibilities in
her telling, Mary Carew looked up with her
face so set and white that Norma, who had
been too intent in her recital to notice the
gradual change in the other's manner, was
startled.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so, Mary," she cried, removing
the child's wraps as she spoke, "I've always
warned you she wasn't any deserted child,
haven't I?" but there was a real tenderness in
Norma's voice as she reminded the other of it.</p>

<p>"You'd better get your supper," Mary replied,
"it's near time for you to be going," and
she pushed her work aside and held out her
arms for the child, her face softening as it did
for nothing else in the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Tired, cold, dazed with crying, the drooping
little soul crept into Mary's arms, which closed
hungrily and held her close as the sobs began
to come again.</p>

<p>Unlike her usual self, Mary let Norma prepare
the supper unaided, while she sat gazing
down on the flushed little face pillowed on her
arm, and drew off the broken shoes, chafing and
rubbing the cold, tired feet with her hand.</p>

<p>She wanted no supper, she declared shortly
in response to Norma's call, but on being
pressed, came to the table and drank a little
tea thirstily, and fed the sleepy child from her
own plate.</p>

<p>"Now don't take on so, Mary, don't fret
about it while I'm gone," Norma begged as she
hurried off to her nightly duties. "I'll miss her
just as much as you, if it does turn out that
we have to give her up, and for the darling's
own sake, Mary, we ought to be glad to think
she's going back to her own."</p>

<p>But Mary, laying the sleeping child down in
the crib, burst forth as the door closed, "An'
it's Norma Bonkowski can tell me I ought to
be glad! She can tell me that, and then say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
she'll miss her the same as me! It's little then
she knows about my feelings,&mdash;for it'll be to
lose the one bright thing outer my life as has
ever come in it. 'Go back to her own!' Like
as not her own's a mother like them fine ones
I see on the Avenoos as leaves their little ones
to grow up with hired nurses. 'Give her up&mdash;give&mdash;her
up&mdash;' Norma says so easy like,&mdash;when
every word chokes me&mdash;" and struggling
against her sobs, Mary fell on her knees beside
the crib, burying her face in the covers, "an' I
must go on sittin' here day after day sewin',
an' my precious one gone; stitchin' an' stitchin',
one day jus' like another stretchin' on ahead,
long as life itself, an' no little feet a-patterin'
up the stairs, an' no little voice a-callin' on me,&mdash;nothin'
to live for, nothin' to keep me from
thinkin' an' thinkin' till I'm nigh to goin' crazy
with the stitchin'&mdash;give her up?"&mdash;a wild look
was on Mary's face as she raised it suddenly, a
desperate one in her eyes&mdash;"I'll not give her
up&mdash;she's mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed at the flushed face
framed about with the sunny hair, then she
rose, and, moving about the room with feverish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
haste, she gathered together certain of the garments
which hung from nails about the walls,
and rolled them into a bundle. Then from
between the mattress and the boards of the bed
she drew an old purse, and counted its contents.</p>

<p>"Two dollars and seventy-five,&mdash;eighty-five,
ninety,&mdash;that's mine,&mdash;the rest is Norma's,"
and she returned the remainder to the hiding-place.
Then, putting on her own hat and
shawl, she lifted the drowsy child, still dressed,
and slipping on her cloak, rolled her in addition,
in the shawl found with her that July morning
almost five months before.</p>

<p>Then grimly picking up child and bundle,
with one guilty, frightened look about the
room that for so many years had meant home
to her, she went out the door and hurried
cautiously down the steps and out into the
snowy night.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>It was half-past twelve when Norma Bonkowski,
returning, climbed the stairs of the
Tenement wearily. She was cold, for her clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
were thin; she was tired, for the day had been
a hard one; she was dispirited, for the manager
had been more than usually sharp and critical
of her performance that night.</p>

<p>When she entered her door the room was
dark. The lamp had burned itself out and the
room was filled with the sickening smell. The
fire, too, was out, save for a few red embers.
With a sudden realization that something was
wrong, Norma groped about the littered mantel-shelf
for a match, then hastily lit an end of
candle. Bed and crib were empty, half the
nails bare of their garments.</p>

<p>"Gone!" cried Norma, beginning to wring
her hands. Intuitively she felt what had
happened. Desperate at the thought of losing
her darling, Mary Carew had fled.</p>

<p>But in a moment a re-assuring look replaced
the fright on the blue, pinched features. "I
know Mary better than she knows herself,"
declared the optimistic Norma, "she'll be
back," and tossing her blonde head resolutely,
she threw aside her hat and cape and began to
rekindle the fire.</p>

<p>"I'll put on the tea-kettle, too," she told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
herself, "and be real comfortable and extravagant
for once, and have a cup of tea ready
when they come," for the good lady had no
intention of going to bed, assuring herself she
would not sleep if she did. So, moving about,
she refilled the lamp, and drawing the machine
nearer the stove, began to sew where Mary
had left off. "I wonder how she thinks to
make a livin'," Norma asked herself, smiling
grimly, "seein' the machine's left behind.
Poor Mary! I know her too well, she'll be back
before morning."</p>

<p>One, two,&mdash;then three, a neighboring church
clock tolled, and Norma stitched and waited,
stitched and waited. Several times she fell
asleep, her head upon the machine, to awake
with a start, hurry to the door and listen.</p>

<p>A little before four she heard a step, and
running to the door caught poor Mary as she
staggered in, half-sinking with her burdens.
Taking the frightened, wailing child and putting
her down by the fire, Norma dragged Mary
to a chair.</p>

<p>"Hush," she commanded, when Mary tried
to speak, "I know&mdash;I understand," and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
once regardless of the child's comfort, she
dragged the sodden shoes from Mary's feet,
drew off the wet skirts and wrapped her in
anything, everything, warm she could find. By
this time Mary was sobbing wildly, and Norma,
half-distracted, turned to draw the tea and to
toast some slices of the stale bread she had
waiting.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, jerking the table around
before Mary, then sitting down and taking up
the child, "you drink that, Mary Carew, before
you dare to say one word!"</p>

<p>The child responded promptly to the warmth
and food and began to chatter. "C'rew did
take Angel away, Norma, and it was cold and
Angel cwied, and C'rew cwied, but the nice lady
sang."</p>

<p>"I tried to run off with her," sobbed Mary,
"but the Lord stood right in my way an'
turned me back."</p>

<p>"Whatever do you mean, Mary?" demanded
Norma.</p>

<p>"Just that, just what I said. I was a-runnin'
off so's to keep her fer my own, an' th' Lord
stopped me an' sent me back."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The child, nodding on Norma's knee like a
rosy little Mandarin, caught the sacred name.
"I p'ay the Lord mine and Joey's and eve'ybody's
soul to keep," she murmured with
drowsy effort, thinking C'rew was urging her
to say the little prayer Miss Ruth had taught
her.</p>

<p>"He will, He will," said Mary Carew with
awed emphasis, "if ever I doubted it before,
Norma, I know now He will. I had been
walkin' a good while after I left here, for I had
laid my plans hasty-like, to cross the river an'
get a room on the other side, for I was jus'
outer my head, Norma, along of the thought
of losin' her,&mdash;an' as I said, I had been walkin'
I don' know how long, plannin' as I went, when
the darlin' woke up, an' begun to cry. An'
jus' then a man opened a door to come out of
a place as had a great sign up, an' in the light
as come out with him, he caught sight of
us.</p>

<p>"'Haven't you no place to go fer shelter, my
poor woman?' he says, for I was kinder breathless,
an' pantin', fer the darlin' an' the bundle
was a weight to carry. But I was that tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
out, I couldn't say nothin' but jus' begin to
cry. Seem' which he says, 'This is one of
the All-Night-Missions, come in an' I will see
if you may stay until morning.'</p>

<p>"Thinkin' as how th' child might be sufferin'
with the cold, I follered him in, a-plannin' to
leave at daylight an' get across the river. I
set down on a bench where he pointed me, an'
when I got my breath I begun to look around.</p>

<p>"It was a nice place, Norma, with picters
round th' walls an' a good fire an' people sittin'
round listenin' to a man talkin', an' when he
stopped, a lady begun to sing a song about
some sheep as were lost.</p>

<p>"Angel here, she had stopped crying soon
as she got warm, an' now she set up, peart an'
smilin', pleased to death with the singin'. An'
when she was done her song, the lady went to
talkin', an' right along, Norma, she was talkin'
straight at me. It mus' have been th' Lord as
tol' her to do it, else how did she know?</p>

<p>"'Rachel,' says she, an' I reckon this Rachel's
another poor such a one as me, don't you,
Norma?&mdash;'Rachel a cryin' for her children
an' there wasn't any comfort for her because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
they weren't there!' That's how she begun.
'There isn't no love,' she said, 'no love on
earth like the love a mother has for her child,
you might take it away,' she said, 'an' try to
fill its place with money an' everything good
in life, but you can't make her stop wantin' her
child an' thinkin' about it, not if you was to
separate them fifty years; or you might try to
beat it out of a mother or starve it out of her,
but if the mother love had ever been there, it'd
be there still.' That's what she said, Norma.
An' she s'posed like the child was lost an' she
said, 'even if there was a lot of children besides
that a one, would she stay at home, contented
like, with them as was safe? No,' she said,
'that mother wouldn't, she'd start out and go
hunt for the one as was lost,&mdash;even to faintin'
along the way, till she found the child or give
up an' died. That's how the Lord cares for
us'&mdash;she said, but I didn't hear no more after
that, for I jus' set there turned like to stone,
goin' over what she said, the darlin' asleep
again in my lap. An' seems like I must a set
there for hours, Norma, fightin' against the
Lord.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"'An' if you as ain't her mother wants her
so,' at last, somethin' inside says to me, 'how
much more must th' mother what's lost her
want her?' and at that, Norma, the Lord won
an' I got up an' come back with the child."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">THE MAJOR OBEYS ORDERS.</span></h2>

<p>"He's going fast." So the nurse whispered
to Miss Stannard, as with Mr. Dilke and Old G.
A. R., she came in that December afternoon.
As the three neared the little bed, shut off by
the screens from the rest of the ward, they
found the Angel already there in the arms of
a tall, dark gentleman, while by Joey's pillow
knelt a slender lady with shining hair and grave,
sweet eyes like the Angel's.</p>

<p>The Major tried to smile a welcome.
"They've come&mdash;ter&mdash;carry&mdash;Angel home,
they have," he whispered, "her dad&mdash;an' her&mdash;mammy."</p>

<p>The white hand of the Angel's "Mammy,"
took Joey's softly and her eyes were full
of tears. "Joey is going home too," she
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Major's eyes wandered questioningly
"The big&mdash;Angel's&mdash;come to get th' little
Angel&mdash;but&mdash;my Mammy&mdash;ain't come&mdash;to get
me?"</p>

<p>"She has not come, Joey dear," the soft
voice explained, "because she is waiting for
you. Joey is going to her."</p>

<p>The little voice was very weak now,&mdash;very
wistful. "Goin'&mdash;now?" asked the Major.</p>

<p>"Yes, Joey."</p>

<p>His whisper could hardly be understood
when after a long pause, he spoke again. "I&mdash;want&mdash;th'
Cap'n&mdash;ter&mdash;gimme&mdash;th'&mdash;order,&mdash;'cause&mdash;I&mdash;b'long&mdash;ter&mdash;th'
Reg'ment."</p>

<p>"What order, Major?" came from the Captain
huskily.</p>

<p>"Old&mdash;G.&mdash;A.&mdash;R.&mdash;he knows&mdash;" the
Major's voice could just be caught now.</p>

<p>Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. who had given the order to
those little feet so many times, knew and understood,
and his big voice rolled out with suspicious
unsteadiness now,&mdash;"Attention&mdash;Company!&mdash;Forward&mdash;"
then the old soldier's voice
broke as the little eyelids fluttered. Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. could not go on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;March!" came softly from Van Alstine
Dilke, and with a ghost of his old, roguish
smile the Major's eyes closed, as he obeyed
orders.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
<span class="caption">TELLS OF THE TENEMENT'S CHRISTMAS.</span></h2>

<p>The Angel had but a week in which to prepare
Christmas for the Tenement, but with the
help of her marshaled forces she did it. With
such a company of grateful assistants as her
Father, her Mother, and the pretty young
Aunt or "Tante" as the Angel called her, all
things seemed possible.</p>

<p>A Christmas Tree it was decreed by her small
ladyship her Tenement should have, and Mrs.
O'Malligan's first floor front, failing entirely
in height or breadth to accommodate it, Mr.
Dilke came forward and offered Miss Angelique
the Armory in the name of the Fourth Regiment.</p>

<p>And such a Tree! How it towered to the
oaken roof and lost itself among the beams,
and laden, festooned, and decorated, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
proudly it spread its great branches out to the
balconies!</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Malligan, alone, of all the Tenement,
was let into the secret, and when it was finally
disclosed, how the hearts of the favored fluttered
as the Angel delivered her invitations,&mdash;every
lady, every lady's husband, and every
son and daughter of the Tenement being bidden
to come. Not to steal in at the back door,
as if the Armory was ashamed of its guests,
but to walk proudly around the square and
enter boldly in at the front doors of the building.
All of which tended to raise the self-respect
of the Tenement, whose spirits went up
very high indeed.</p>

<p>And on that eventful Christmas Day, when
the guests who were bidden had arrived, it was
discovered that the object most desired of each
good lady's heart, was to be found on, or
around the base of that Tree. Perhaps if Mrs.
O'Malligan had explained the meanings of the
many mysterious conferences that had taken
place lately in her first floor front, the ladies
might better have understood.</p>

<p>There was a pretty carpet, as well as lace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
curtains, long the desire of little Mrs. Tomlins'
ambition, the set of "chiny" dishes dear to
another good lady, a dress for this one, a bonnet,
a nice rocking chair for that,&mdash;with new
hats, pipes and tobacco around for the men,&mdash;and
in addition for Mr. Tomlin, an entire
suit of clothes and an overcoat, did that wonderful
Tree shed upon his proud shoulders.</p>

<p>Candy, nuts, and fruit were there in abundance,
open to all, while the children paused,&mdash;awed,
under a deluge of toys such as their eyes
had never beheld the likeness of before.</p>

<p>Nor was this all,&mdash;for somewhere about that
Tree, hung a document, which being delivered,
revealed to Miss Norma Bonkowski that she
was now the owner and proprietor of that same
Costumer's establishment she had so coveted,&mdash;while
a most innocent and ordinary looking
little book bearing Mary Carew's name told
the secret of a sum of money safely in bank, so
sufficient that never again need that grim
phantom, the poor-house, threaten to overshadow
the end as it had the beginning of
Mary's life.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. O'Malligan,&mdash;who had so suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>cessfully betrayed the secrets of her neighbors,
she was the most surprised of all to find her
own discovered. For, learning that the O'Malligans'
savings toward "a house of our own
over th' river wid a goat an' a bit of a pig-sty,"
still lacked a small sum of being sufficient, the
Angel had accordingly completed the amount.</p>

<p>And then the Tenement, weary with the accumulations
of pleasure and surprise, had taken
itself home.</p>

<p>No one had been forgotten. Even the sixty
little Kindergartens, through the combined
munificence of Mr. Dilke and the Angel, were,
according to the gloomy prophecies of 'Tildy
Peggins as she waited upon them at the feast,
"a stuffed to their little stomicks' heverlastin'
undoin'." And Old&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R., from the depths of
a new arm-chair, tried to solace his lonely old
heart with whiffs of fragrant tobacco from a
wonderful new pipe.</p>

<p>Neither was Joey forgotten in this time of
rejoicing, for St. Luke's was made glad that
Christmas Day when the Fourth Regiment endowed
a child cot's "In memory of The Little
Major."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Rosy O'Brien, whose one act of unfaithfulness
had been so terribly punished, was
made happy by the news her little Angelique
brought her, that now since she was freed of
her wearing secret, her health would begin to
return. And in time it did, and long after,
when her tongue could again frame its words,
she dictated such a letter of contrition and remorse
to Mrs. Breaux, that that gentle heart's
last feelings against her were forgotten. In
this letter, too, the poor girl related the happenings
of the afternoon when she left the
Hotel.</p>

<p>Allured by the shop windows, she and her
charge had stopped so often that on reaching
the river, they learned of the accident which
had just taken place in mid-river. At this, the
girl had hurried back and crossed by the
bridge.</p>

<p>On reaching the Tenement finally, and finding
her sister's door locked, and beginning to
feel anxious about returning, on the impulse of
the moment, that she might go down the faster,
being breathless with the climb up the steep
and broken stairs, she set the tired and sleepy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
child down on her shawl in the adjoining room,
whose door stood open, and hurried down to
find Mrs. O'Malligan and beg a scrap of paper
to write a few lines to put under her sister's
door.</p>

<p>Again Fate was against her. Mrs. O'Malligan's
door was locked, and she determined to
run across to the corner grocery to beg a bit of
paper and pencil from Mr. Buckley's brother
Bill who clerked there, and learn something of
the absent family. And here, while crossing
the street in nervous haste, she had been
knocked down in a press of vehicles,&mdash;and so
the long chapter of strange accidents was set
going.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>A few days after Christmas the prima donna
of The Garden Opera House was found in her
luxurious sitting-room, by her maid, face downward
on the couch,&mdash;in tears, the result of a
state of mind, caused, as it proved, by a visit
from the little Angelique and her beautiful
mother.</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you for your gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>erous
impulse," Mrs. Breaux had said, in impulsive,
sweet fashion, taking the wayward,
beautiful, young creature's hand in hers, "or
how can I ever be grateful enough to the good
God for surrounding my darling with such love
and preserving her, as He has done, from the
evils of this terrible city," and she had cried
and trembled even then, with the child there
against her knee, calling and prattling to the
green and yellow parrot on his gilded perch.</p>

<p>"If only some one could have understood
all the poor child tried to tell," said the prima
donna, "but her dear, funny little lisp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is no wonder they could not," cried the
mother in quick exoneration of her child's
Tenement friends, "her speech was a comical
mixture of her father's French, my English,
and the nurse's Irish brogue,&mdash;even Mr. Breaux
gave up often in despair, and would turn for
me to interpret."</p>

<p>It followed, then, that Angelique had been
brought to tell the great singer good-bye, and
in speaking of her first meeting with her at the
Opera House, the prima donna referred to the
child's wonderful grace, her poise. "She has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
more than talent," the professional woman said,
"she has genius."</p>

<p>"It is a love of motion born in her," replied
the mother, "my sisters have it before her.
Angelique danced actually before she could talk,
and my sister took her to dancing school and
kindergarten when she was little more than a
baby, because it seemed such a pleasure to the
child."</p>

<p>And then it so happened the singer was led
to speak of her own life, of her wretched,
motherless childhood, her poverty, the discovery
of her voice and her subsequent success.</p>

<p>"A success that sometimes seems but ashes
in my mouth," she sobbed, as the young mother
gathered her in her arms and comforted her
with words which to her impulsive, untaught,
undisciplined heart were as "apples of gold,"
and which sank too deep to ever be forgotten.
And it was following this visit that her maid
found her in tears.</p>

<p class="spaced">*****</p>

<p>Pretty Miss Stannard sighed, as with Mr.
Dilke in attendance, she was walking up from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the station, having seen Angelique, her mother,
father, and Tante off for their southern home.
"How nice," she sighed, "for them to have
been able to show their gratitude as they have;
money can do anything."</p>

<p>But Mr. Dilke, who, of late had had reason
to question the desirability of being a rich
young man, since the conscientious and analytical
young person by his side had returned
an unfavorable answer to a certain matrimonial
proposition on his part, alleging her inability
to determine how far her affections were biased
by sordidness. So Mr. Dilke shook his head
and took a sidelong glance at his companion's
pretty profile. "No, money cannot," he returned
promptly in refutation of her statement,
"all mine cannot give me the one thing that
makes the rest seem worth while."</p>

<p>"Nor would you want that one thing if it
could," returned Miss Stannard quite as
promptly, though what little of her profile Mr.
Dilke could catch sight of now, so attractive
did something prove across the way&mdash;grew a
beautiful rosy red as she spoke,&mdash;"no, money
could not give you that. I've thought and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
thought until I am quite&mdash;convinced&mdash;of that&mdash;though
if you just could be poor,&mdash;real nice
and poverty-stricken long enough to test me,&mdash;I'd
always feel safer&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And when, in time, a successor was found to
supply Miss Stannard's place at the Darcy
Settlement's Free Kindergarten, it was to see
the Angel in her beautiful southern home that
Mr. Van Alstine took his pretty, young wife.
And there, whom did they find,&mdash;her face all
softened and transfigured with happiness, tending
her beloved charge with jealous care&mdash;but
Mary Carew!</p>

<p>"There is a touch of pure poetic fancy in each of the tales, and the
sunbeams here invested with life and tiny human forms, are lovable
and mirth-provoking imps.... The children, too, are real children,
and there is no mawkish sentimentality, but an unforced, tender pathos
in the story of little Tom Riley, who was 'mos twelve,' but who had a
heart big enough for a man, and so skilfully is it told that a child may
read and miss much of the sadness of it. In and out and everywhere
play the sunbeams, as merry, mischievous and kindly a set of sprites as
any in the realms of fairyland."&mdash;<i>The Sun</i>, New York.</p>

<p>In these stories, the Sunbeams are made to talk and laugh and play,
just like children. They are delightful. Sometimes when they are
naughty, Father Sun shuts them up in a cloud all day, where it is wet
and rainy, and then they get good and promise not to tease and be bad
any more. And then he lets them out, and they come down among the
flowers and children and make everything bright and happy. The
fancy is pretty, and we are sure the little children will thoroughly enjoy
the little Sunbeams. Pretty pictures and fine press-work and paper,
make it a beautiful book.&mdash;<i>Christian Observer</i>, Louisville, Ky.</p>

<p>The "ship's company" that embarked one May
morning for a holiday cruise on the "cat-boat" <i>Lady
Gray</i>, consisted according to "the log," of the skipper,
two cabin-boys, one ship's clerk, one small child, and
two supernumeraries. The ship's clerk, who kept "the
log," was a young girl, the small child was a much
younger girl, and the supernumeraries were two dolls,
who came in for a fair share of adventure, although
they did not, like the others, suffer from "short commons,"
or join in the welcome meal of "hoe cake and
sorghum," with difficulty obtained from the half famished
"company." The story is one for young people;
it is pleasantly told, and will be appreciated, especially
